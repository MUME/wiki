Upon achieving level 21, MUME characters are deemed
'[heroic](hero "wikilink")'. They gain the option of choosing their own
[title](title "wikilink") (via [Change](Change "wikilink") TITLE); they
may also gain certain abilities depending on their race and alignment.
These abilities include creating a [focus](focus "wikilink"), becoming
an [Istar](Istari "wikilink"), and casting some 'special' spells.
