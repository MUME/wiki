Upon achieving level 21, MUME characters are deemed
'[heroic](hero "wikilink")'. They gain the option of choosing their own
[title](title "wikilink") (via [Change](Change "wikilink") TITLE); they
may also gain certain abilities depending on their race and alignment.
These abilities include creating a [focus](focus "wikilink"), becoming
an [Istar](Istari "wikilink"), and casting some 'special' spells.

Characters of level 26 and above are called 'legends'. Advancement as a
[legend](legend "wikilink") is ten times slower than as a non-legend.

The higher level legends (level 30 or greater) that are of the races of
the Free Peoples of Arda may buy a 'house' known as a 'legend home'
which they can then create using the standard room creation commands.
There are many special rules regarding this, and these may be obtained
from the help files and from the responsible Ainur.
