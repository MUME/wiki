\> A huge, black wolf is here, ready to devour.
\> **look wolf**
Large, even by the standards of black wolves, this beast is a true
killer,
afraid of no one. As large as some wargs, its howl strikes terror into
even
the most hardened elf or orc. Forever hungry, the wolf attacks
mercilessly.
A huge, black wolf has several bruises.
