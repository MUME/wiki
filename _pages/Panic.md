If you flee out of combat (as opposed to making an ordered retreat via
the 'escape' command) you may be affected by panic for a short time.
When you are in a state of panic you will find that your offensive
abilities are reduced. Though the durations of multiple panics are not
cumulative, their effects on your ability to fight are.
