\> A moaning ghost advances towards you, shimmering with a pale light.

\> **look ghost**

The ghost is dressed like some sort of ancient priest, its face pale

and expressionless. From the head down its substance slowly fades

away to become totally transparent near the feet, making the ghost

float softly above the ground.
