title: Snakeskin belt
---

<nowiki>g CW\>exa belt The belt looks very tough, as it is made out of a
long snakeskin. You notice the black stripes form a diamond pattern, and
surmise that the hide once covered a large rattlesnake. Its colour is
light brown, almost leading into a light grey. The scales on it are very
strong and form a durable material.

CW\>con belt It is a snakeskin belt. It weighs half a pound.

--Opinion-- It is a lightweight belt compared to normal leather belt.
