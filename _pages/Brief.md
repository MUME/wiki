Usage: brief \[on\|off\]

Toggle "brief mode". When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions
of the room you are in; only the name of the room, and the people and
objects in there. Unless you are very familiar with the area in which
you travel, however, it is not advisable to use this command.
Frequently, you will find small, but vital hints in the descriptions of
the rooms: more attention to your surroundings could mean the difference
between life and death!

Note: When you use the command "examine", you always see the description
of a room (with or without 'brief' mode).

It is helpful if players remain in brief mode when they know an area
well, as it reduces CPU load.

With "brief mode" off, MUME will also show you what language other
people are speaking, provided that they aren't speaking the same
language as you and that you know the language being spoken well enough.
