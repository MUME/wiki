Usage: [change](change "wikilink") **brief** \[on\|off\]

Toggle "brief mode". When in brief mode, you don't see the descriptions
of the [room](room "wikilink") you are in; only the name of the room,
and the people and objects in there. Unless you are very familiar with
the area in which you travel, however, it is not advisable to use this
command. Frequently, you will find small, but vital hints in the
descriptions of the rooms: more attention to your surroundings could
mean the difference between life and [death](death_trap "wikilink")!

Note: When you use the command '[examine](examine "wikilink")', you
always see the description of a room (with or without 'brief' mode).

It is helpful if players remain in brief mode when they know an area
well, as it reduces CPU load.

With "brief mode" off, MUME will also show you what
[language](language "wikilink") other people are speaking, provided that
they aren't speaking the same language as you and that you know the
language being spoken well enough.
