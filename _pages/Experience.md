Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.
When enough experience and [travel points](travel_points "wikilink") are
earned, you'll gain a [level](level "wikilink"). You can see how much is
left until the next level when you type '[stat](stat "wikilink")'.
Things you should know about experience points:

`* When damaging a monster, you get experience points. (Magic included)`

`* When you damage or kill a monster, the knowledge gained from that monster`
`  is added to your `[`Trophy`](Trophy "wikilink")`. The more knowledge you have of that monster, the`
`  less experience you will derive from it in the future.`

`* When you fight a monster within a group, the experience is split among the`
`  members of the group who are present. Likewise, the knowledge gained is`
`  split proportionately.`

We strongly discourage the killing of other players of the same side if
you are not an Orc, but the choice is yours.

If you are killed by a mobile, you will lose a great deal of experience
points as punishment, and all of your gold and equipment will be left
behind where you died. You will not lose travel points for death.

If you lose sufficient experience points to put your current number
below that which is required for your level, you will lose a level.
