The "**protect**" [command](commands "wikilink") is used to select a
number of people (players or [mobiles](mobile "wikilink")) that you will
try to protect from attacks.

When someone tries to [hit](hit "wikilink") one of those in your
"protected-list", you get an attempt to intercept the blow. The chance
to succeed depends on how high you know the [rescue](rescue "wikilink")
[skill](skill "wikilink").

If you have more than one person on your list, or if you already are
[fighting](combat "wikilink"), your chance to succeed is lowered. If the
person to be protected knows the [escape](escape "wikilink") skill, the
chance of success improves.

Only physical attacks (hit, [bash](bash "wikilink") and
[kick](kick "wikilink")) are affected by this command.

Example: protect lists who you will try to protect protect frodo toggles
wether you will try to protect Frodo or not protect myself clears the
list of people you will protect
