title: Protect

The \`protect' command is used to select a number of people (players or
mobiles) that you will try to protect from attacks.

When someone tries to hit one of those in your "protected-list", you get
an attempt to intercept the blow. The chance to succeed depends on how
high you know the rescue skill.

If you have more than one person on your list, or if you already are
fighting, your chance to succeed is lowered. If the person to be
protected knows the escape skill, the chance of success improves.

Only physical attacks (hit, bash and kick) are affected by this command.

Example: <nowiki>g

` protect             lists who you will try to protect`
` protect frodo       toggles wether you will try to protect Frodo or not`
` protect myself      clears the list of people you will protect`
