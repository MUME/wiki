title: Parry bonus

The **parry bonus** (PB%) is a defensive bonus. It is similar to your
[dodge bonus](dodge_bonus "wikilink") (DB%). There are some notable
differences though.

While your parry bonus is divided by the number of opponents you are
facing in combat, your dodge bonus is not. You will dodge just as well
against 3 enemies as you do against one. While you will only block hits
(parry) from enemies 33% as well when facing 3 enemies.

Your parry bonus is most affected by the [weapon](weapon "wikilink") and
[shield](shield "wikilink") you are using, along with your skill in that
particular weapon. High strength and dexterity will help boost your
affinity for the [parry](parry "wikilink") skill
([warrior](warrior "wikilink") class), which will in turn boost your
parry bonus significantly.

There are also some other rare items that can boost your parry bonus,
along with the "[bless](bless "wikilink")" spell.

In general, [slashing weapons](slashing_weapon "wikilink") will provide
the best parry bonuses, [daggers](Piercing_weapon "wikilink"),
[axes](Cleaving_weapon "wikilink"), [concussion
weapons](concussion_weapon "wikilink"), and
[spears](stabbing_weapon "wikilink") will provide moderate bonuses, and
[two-handed weapons](two-handed_weapon "wikilink") will provide the
least parry bonus.
