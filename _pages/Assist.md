title: "Assist"

Assist lets you join somebody who is already fighting.

The main advantage of this is if there are numerous mobiles of the same
name. Typing hit \<1.mobile\> etc. can sometimes lead to players
attacking the 'wrong' one.

Example:

` > assist petrel`

"assist" by itself will make you assist a group member.
