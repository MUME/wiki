title: Assist
---

The **assist** command lets you join somebody who is already
[fighting](combat "wikilink").

The main advantage of this is if there are numerous
[mobiles](mobile "wikilink") of the same name. Typing
'[hit](hit "wikilink") \<1.mobile\>' etc. can sometimes lead to players
attacking the 'wrong' one.

Example:

` > assist petrel`

"assist" by itself will make you assist a [group](group "wikilink")
member.
