*For the class commonly referred to as scout, see
[thief](thief "wikilink").*

The '<b>scout</b> <direction>' command allows one to examine a
neighbouring [room](room "wikilink") (in that direction).

Most of the time you will examine that room without going into it.
However, if the exit is some kind of one-way, you will end up in the
other room regardless. If you scout a room that is a [death
trap](death_trap "wikilink"), you will die.

If you are scouting a small room (typically indoor) while not
[hidden](hide "wikilink"), you will be spotted by whoever is in it.
Otherwise, you have a chance of not being discovered. Scouting a large
room makes it harder to see any hidden content, but at the same time it
is easier to scout it unnoticed, even while not hidden.

The detail level of the scouted room, how you are seen when discovered,
and the scouting delays depend upon the size of the involved rooms.
