Some places in [Arda](Arda "wikilink") are considered being well suited
for keeping watch of the surrounding terrains. These are known as
**watchtowers**, but can be anything between the tower of a castle and a
high hill.

If you find one of these watchtowers, you can use the command **watch**
to start keeping watch over the [terrain](terrain "wikilink") around
you. When in 'watch-mode', you get information about players moving
about where you can see them.

You can also use [search](search "wikilink") <direction> to scan for
people standing still.
