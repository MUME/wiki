This command is used for wearing some clothes, armour or the like. If a
piece of clothing or armour does not fit or is worn out you may mend it
at an armoury in a nearby city.

Examples: <nowiki>g

` > wear cloak`
` > wear all`

You may also specify where to wear something, but in that case you
cannot specify more than one object: <nowiki>g

` > wear baldric back`
` You put a leather baldric on your back.`
` > wear baldric quiver`
` You put a leather baldric over your shoulder.`
