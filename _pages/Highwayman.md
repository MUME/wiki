**Highwaymen** are level ? [mobiles](mobile "wikilink") who accompany
[Morthan Blacksoul](Morthan_Blacksoul "wikilink") at the obstruction in
[Greenway](Greenway "wikilink"). While not initially aggressive, they
will remember if you've attacked them or any of their allies and become
hostile to you. They load 1 silver and 50 copper, a sword, a
[shield](shield "wikilink") and some common cloth or leather equipment.

`A highwayman is here, grinning evilly at you.`
`>`**`examine man`**
`Callous, calculating eyes consider you and your purse, apparently judging his`
`chances for getting richer. He seems experienced in the ways of the world,`
`obviously taking no chances.`
