While wearing a quiver, a bolt case or a pouch for slingstones, you can
RECOVER the missiles lying around -- those on the ground, the ones stuck
in corpses and the ones in your inventory. You will grab all the
missiles you shot or bought, and put them back in your quiver.

You can also "recover all": this will make you get all visible missiles,
no matter if they are yours or not.
