title: Recover
---

While wearing a quiver, a bolt case or a pouch for slingstones, you can
**recover** the [missiles](ammunition "wikilink") lying around -- those
on the ground, the ones stuck in [corpses](corpse "wikilink") and the
ones in your inventory. You will grab all the missiles you shot or
bought, and put them back in your quiver.

You can also 'recover all': this will make you get all visible missiles,
no matter if they are yours or not.
