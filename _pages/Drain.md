title: "Drain"
---

Orcs and Trolls can fill their skin, or any drink container they have,
with the blood of their fallen enemies.

The blood is a tasty beverage for the Orcs; if they need to keep it for
a longer duration, or for a use as ingredient for a herblore, they have
to ask one of their wise leaders to transform it into a more stable
form.

Syntax: 'drain corpse'
