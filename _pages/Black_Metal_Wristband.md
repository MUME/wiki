title: Black Metal Wristband

## Statistics

!# CW\>**examine wristband**
This wristband is made of some dull black metal. Not any decorations or
other
scratches can be found on it. Its plain black colour seems to absorb
every beam
of light. The metal feels cold, and some strange energy seems to flow
from the
item when touched.


!# CW\>**consider wristband**
It is a black metal wristband (flawless, new).
It weighs half a pound.
It fits you well.


## Opinions

This wristband behaves in much the same way as smooth padded boots,
strange black helmet and also the large visored helm; that is they can
have three copies in game at any one time (though it is unlikely). It's
actual effects are to manipulate OB/DB/PB according to your mood. When
in aggressive mood, the wristband will convert some DB into OB. When
wimpy, it will convert some PB into DB, which is of arguable benefit in
such small amounts, but a benefit none the less because you will end up
with slightly more defense. Dwarves are said to gain an even greater
boost to OB when in berzerk mood, compared to other races, although the
actual benefits of this are very limited.
