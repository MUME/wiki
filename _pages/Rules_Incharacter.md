Posting on the In-Character boards should be strictly as the name
implies: in-character. That means that no information which is know to
the player but not to the character, should be posted. Thus

1\. Mentioning "Level", "Exp" or some such stat-related quantities is
wrong.

2\. Posting about your [death](death "wikilink") is not allowed, even if
the game allows for reincarnation.

3\. Mentioning things that are from the real world is not allowed. (For
example: Bilbo is as fast as a Ferrari.)

If in doubt, avoid putting it in a post. Note that the board is
moderated.
