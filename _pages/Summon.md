**Summon** is a level 8 [cleric](cleric "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). It will transfer a creature or player to the
location of the caster. The [equipment](equipment "wikilink") will
remain at the original location. To transfer the equipment too, use the
[Transfer](Transfer "wikilink") spell. It can be used to quickly get a
needed [mobile](mobile "wikilink"), like a horse or a potential charmie
of some type. Because of the high mana cost, it is however rarely used.

Wearing a [ring](ring "wikilink") (or collar for shape-shifting
[bears](bear "wikilink")) can protect against being summoned
involuntarily.
