If you want to **sing** to all the other players in the game, sing it
with the command 'sing <argument>'. You can choose whether to receive
songs or not from other players by using the command
'[listen](listen "wikilink") songs'.

NOTE: The effort you make when communicating with other players on a
global level takes its toll. Singing reduces your [movement
points](movement_points "wikilink").

NOTE: A 'sing' without any arguments is a [social
command](socials "wikilink").

Example:

` > sing Oh, Elbereth!`

[Shout](Shout "wikilink"), [Listen](Listen "wikilink"),
[Ignore](Ignore "wikilink")
