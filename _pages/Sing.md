If you want to sing to all the other players in the game, sing it with
the command 'sing <argument>'. You can choose whether to receive songs
or not from other players by using the command "LISTEN SONGS".

NOTE: The effort you make when communicating with other players on a
global level takes its toll. Singing reduces your movement points.

NOTE: A 'sing' without any arguments is a social command.

Example:

` > sing Oh, Elbereth!`
