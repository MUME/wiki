"Roleplaying" means attempting to play your character as if he/she were
a real inhabitant of Tolkien's world, with a life story, understandable
motivations, who must interact realistically with other characters and
with the environment - not just a mechanical device for getting 'points'
and 'levels'.

Top management here favors role-play and encourages it, though we do not
require it. Commands that will help you roleplay include:

- CHANGE DESCRIPTION - lets you describe your physical appearance, what
  people will see when they look at you.
- CHANGE WHOIS - edits what people will see when they type 'whois
  <your name>'. This could include what is generally known about you:
  your reputation and recent exploits.

There are some books on roleplaying in some of the libraries.
Roleplaying cannot be imposed on players by management - at least, we
aren't willing to do it here - but we reserve the right to encourage it
with coded features from time to time. For example, elves (or other
Westerners) who commit crimes against peaceful inhabitants of the west
can expect that their alignment will suffer strongly and maybe some
protectors of good will deal harshly with them. We also will require
your characters to act as separate characters (not helping each other
with equipment, arranging ambushes together, etc.) - see the different
[RULE](Rules "wikilink") headings for this (e.g. [Rules Character
Separation](Rules_Character_Separation "wikilink")).

Beyond this, we would hope that players who enjoy role-playing will come
together for mutual enjoyment. Please use the [Idea](Idea "wikilink")
command to suggest ways in which management can help.
