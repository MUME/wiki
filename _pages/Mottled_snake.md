\> A mottled snake is sneaking here, ready to sink its fangs into
flesh.
\> **look snake**
This snake is very hard to see, blending in well with its surroundings.
On
closer inspection, its scales are a patchwork of varying shades of
grey,
making it look almost sick. The size of the snake and its fangs give
you
ample warning of its threat.
