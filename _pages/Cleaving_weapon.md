**[Cleaving weapons](Cleaving_weapons "wikilink")** are one of the
[weapon](weapon "wikilink") types found in [MUME](MUME "wikilink"). Most
are efficient vs. wood and have high [strength](strength "wikilink")
requirements. Axes are especially useful for [dwarves](dwarf "wikilink")
thanks to the +5 offensive bonus they receive when standing with their
feet firm on the ground.

  offensive axe, favoured by many cleaving warriors
- [blackened dwarven axe](blackened_dwarven_axe "wikilink") (BDA) - good
  offensive axe. Especially effective against spirits, ghosts, and
  wraiths.
- [double-headed axe](double-headed_axe "wikilink") - High OB, but
