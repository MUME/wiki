## The Book of Lost Tales

In the Valaquenta and the AinulindalÃ« can be found the tale of MUME as
passed down by the Valar and the Maiar, but what of the stories of
mortals doomed to die?

Here can be found a collection of tales lost wayback and found deep in
the spider's tapestry that held the world together once upon a time.
