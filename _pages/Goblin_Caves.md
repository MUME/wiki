The Goblin Caves are a system of caves just to the west and south of the
Fork in the Trail to the Misty Mountains. They are east of the Dark
Tower (Misty Mountains Dark Tower, not the Dark Tower of Sauron), and
west of the New Orkish Caves.

The Goblin caves are usually used for midlevel xp. They are also
occasionally used for PK. There are two entrances, both of which are
blockable. Within the caves, there is another door that is also
blockable. The lore for the Psylonia poison also loads here, along with
some metal armor, on the Goblin Chieftain.

Tips:

Be careful with how many goblins you take on at one time. They assist
each other, and the goblin warriors have the bash skill. Low level
characters can quickly become overwhelmed.

Be careful with who you target. The goblin warriors do not yell when
attacked, but the scouts do. Be aware of alerting unfriendly enemy
players who may be near. They could hear the shouts and be led right to
you. In a bottleneck with blockable exits, this will usually spell doom
for xpers.
