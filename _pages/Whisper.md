If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or
ask.

Say is heard by everyone in your room, while the other three commands;
ask, tell and whisper, are only heard by the person who you are talking
to.

Examples:

` > `[`Tell`](Tell "wikilink")` CryHavoc You're dead meat - sucker!     [not advised]`
` > `[`Whisper`](Whisper "wikilink")` thief Wanna teach me some illegal stuff?`
` > `[`Ask`](Ask "wikilink")` bilbo Have you found that ring yet?`
` > `[`Say`](Say "wikilink")` Hi guys, lets go orc hunting?!`
` > `[`Comment`](Comment "wikilink")` duh gotta go AFK a sec, building on fire`

NOTE: All commands except '[Comment](Comment "wikilink")' (that can be
abbreviated '-') are meant for In Character (IC) communication.
Communication on player to player level is held with the
'[Comment](Comment "wikilink")' command.

NOTE: Apostrophe (') is a shorter form of the [Say](Say "wikilink")
command;

NOTE: The outputs of [Say](Say "wikilink"),
[Whisper](Whisper "wikilink"), [Ask](Ask "wikilink") and
[Narrate](Narrate "wikilink") are influenced by the comprehension level
of the language that is being used, [Tell](Tell "wikilink") and
[Emote](Emote "wikilink") are not.
