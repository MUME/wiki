title: Morthan Blacksoul
---

**Morthan Blacksoul** is a bandit who has set up an obstruction on the
[Greenway](Greenway "wikilink") to rob unsuspecting travellers. If you
enter his [room](room "wikilink"), he will demand some
[gold](gold "wikilink") from you, and spam-[close](close "wikilink") the
exits until you pay him. While not initially aggressive, if you attack
him, he will remember it and attack the next time he sees you. He loads
13 silver, a [double-edged eket](double-edged_eket "wikilink"), a [black
metal shield](black_metal_shield "wikilink") and some plain cloth
equipment.

`A tall blackclad man pierces you with eyes cold as steel.`

`A tall man with a proud bearing, this man pierces your soul with eyes black`
`as coal, and with a smirk on his face he demands that you make payment.`

## Strategy

Morthan won't auto-close the exits if he's fighting, so one way to avoid
paying him is to [hit](hit "wikilink") him and then open exit and
[flee](flee "wikilink") out. He is joined in combat by [Thena
Shadowstalker](Thena_Shadowstalker "wikilink") and 5
[highwaymen](highwayman "wikilink").
