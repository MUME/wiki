title: Glamdring
---

This broad shiny blade was crafted by the Elves of Gondolin in the
[First Age](First_Age "wikilink") of [Middle
Earth](Middle_Earth "wikilink") for their king, the Noldor King Turgon.
It's special purpose was to slay orcs, and that it did well. The name
Glamdring is [Sindarin](Sindarin "wikilink") for *Foe-hammer*, but the
orcs who fear it call it [Beater](Beater "wikilink").

It was lost after King Turgon was slain and Gondolin had fallen.
