“It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto
the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you
might be swept off to.”

Gandalf, JRRT, The Fellowship of the Ring

This guide is about travel points and hints and suggestions of how to
get them.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at: <https://mume.org/help/help_index>

**Bold** words can be looked up in the games help files. Like help
**travel points**.

**Travel points** are required for gaining levels, and is MUME's way of
encouraging you to explore the world and the map. Travel points are
often abbreviated as **tps**.

## **Information about your Travel Points**

### Level:

This command shows you what you need for XP and TPs for the next 5
levels. Every time you **level** up, it updates your list with the next
**level** you need.

Level 1 1 exp, 0 tp Level 2 1,000 exp, 100 tp Level 3 3,000 exp, 300 tp
Level 4 7,000 exp, 600 tp Level 5 14,500 exp, 1,000 tp ...But the list
does not end there...

### Stat:

This command shows you how much tps you need for the next level. If it
says 0 tps needed, you are ahead of the tps you need. Over all for
leveling purposes, it's good to try to stay a little head on tps.

===<Info:===> On one line, this command shows you how many XP and TPs
you've gained.

You have scored 21,552,689 experience points and you have 144,252 travel
points.

### Prompt:

You can also choose to turn on the tps needed in your prompt. Check out
**help prompt**

`change prompt tp`

### Achievement

You can also get a hint about areas you have or have not explored well
from your list of achievements. It is usually towards the top of your
achievement list. The game keeps track of where you have visited.

### Map Travelled:

This command shows zones near you and how much you have visited them. It
is a bit more specific then the Achievement information.

Here is an example. Map of your travels on Nearby Zones
----------------------------- \| - \| \| - \| \| - \| \| ?? ?-? ?\|
\|=?? .. .-=== ??\| \|+?? =====-X=======-------\| \| =++=====.--=.+ \|
\| + \| \| == \| \| = ?\| \| = ?\| \| = ?\| \| -- ?\| \| --- ??\| \|
----- ??? \| ----------------------------- You can also look at map
global travel to see the entire game map for this information.

## **Explaining TPs**

Travel Points are a 'reward' for exploring, travelling, and moving
around the rooms and **map**.

They are required for leveling up, much like **experience points**. You
can always gain more travel points then what you need to level up. So it
is totally fine to have enough travel points to be, say, 3 levels ahead.

You can also gain XP past what is required for you next level, if you do
not have enough TPs to level up.

The lowest amount of travel points a room in the game can have is 0.

The highest amount of travel points a room can have is 100.

Gaining 200 tps really isn't that difficult... but trying to gain 3000
tps can take a while.

It is common and frustrating to enter rooms that are giving you 5 or
less tps per room...

Rooms with 30-40 or more tps in them are very nice finds, but you might
not find them often!

Rooms that are frequently visited by many players, tend to have low
travel points. For example the Old East Road between Bree and Shire. Is
very often travelled by many players, almost never a single travel point
is there.

To gain more travel points, you want to try and visit rooms and areas of
the game that are not visited very often. Even a room in the back of a
often visited city, with no services in it, can have 10 tps sometimes.

Rooms that are very rarely visited tend to store up travel points over
time, until someone visits that room. Say a player visits a room, and
gains 50 travel points from it, then a few minutes later you enter the
same room, you'll get zero travel points. That other player got them all
and the room has not had time to accumulate more of them yet. A room
accumulating tps can take a long time.

DISCLAIMER!!! This may or may NOT be how it works, but you can use this
as a guide to understanding travel points.

Lets say a room has 100 travel points in it, and someone enters that
room. Those travel points are then redistributed around the rest of the
rooms in the game. If a room hits 100 travel points, it stops
accumulating any new travel points, and they instead go to other rooms
that have not been visited very much or very recently.

## **TPs and Grouping**

If you are in a **group**, you share the travel points in a room, but
it's not evenly shared. The leader of the group, entering the room
first, gains a small bonus, while the rest of the members of the group
gain about 20% less travel points from that room.

So over all getting TPs while solo OR while leading a group is the
fastest way to gain them. If you are constantly following someone, you
may notice you struggle to stay ahead on TPs.

See **help travel points** for a better explanation of math behind this.

Fallohide hobbits gain a racial bonus bonus to gaining or sharing travel
points in a group.

See **help fallowhide** or **help hobbit** for more information.

## **How to Gain TPs**

There are several different ways to gain travel points in MUME. If you
are mixing all styles of gathering together, you should stay current on
your amount of tps needed.

### Quests

Quests do not just reward you with coins, gear, herblore knowledge,
citizenships, or xp. A few quests in the game grant TPs as a reward, the
first time you do the quest.

So attempting to do alot of quests can eventually gain you 100's of
travel points as rewards.

If the quest gives this message, that means you earned some TPs as part
of the reward:

`With the task complete, you feel more travelled.`

### Discovering Secret Doors

Every time you discover a secret door, you gain 9 TPs. This may not
sound like much, but discover 40 secret exits, and you'll get a nice
bump to your TPs total.

There are different ways to discover the secret exits. If someone else
has left the door open, and you walk into the room and see it, that
counts as a discovery. If you attempt to open the door, but you cannot
because it is locked, does damage, or is too heavy, that also counts as
a discovery.

If the exit is a 'secret' on both sides of the opening, that counts as 2
discoveries! 18 tps!

To see how many secret exits you have discovered, type **achieve exit**.

The character you are playing only gains this bonus 9 tps once for
discovering that exit. You can't re-discover it later for the same
gains.

### Travelling Across Zones

The first time you visit a zone, you get some bonus TPs during your
first visit. If you visit the zone again, you do not gain this first
visit bonus of TPs. So simply travelling around to new zones you have
not been to is one way to gain some TPs.

Check out the **map travelled** command to see where you have and have
not been.

`help map trav, map trav, map g trav`

At lower levels one way to gain this bonus is simply to ride from city
to city. Maybe try a path like this:

Blue mountains, to Grey Havens, to Tower Hills, to Greenholm, to Shire
(visit every zone in the Shire it's pretty safe), to Bree, then Fornost.
You'll have a decent amount of tps built up by traveling to that many
new zones.

It can help to use a good mount with a saddle, like a trained horse,
mountain mule, warhorse, dales pony.

Some skills, such as **Ride**, **Wilderness**, **Endurance**, and
**Breath of Briskness** can help with travelling, or an herblore like
**Walking**.

If you use one of MUME's transports to travel, instead of riding or
walking, you will not get tps for the trip. You will still get tps for
the zone you arrived in, but not the journey.

Examples are:

-using the Coach between Fornost, Bree, and Tharbad

-using the Grey Ship between Grey Havens Harlond and Tharbad

-using the White Ship between Grey Havens Harlond and Valinor

-using a Great Eagle for flying over zones

### Exploring

Walking around a zone room by room can also gain you some TPs. Try
visiting places that players do not go to very often. Sometimes palces
behind locked doors, rooms you need to swim too, or even more dangerous
swim underwater too, places that you need to climb too, and other hard
to reach spots often will have some more TPs then other places.

One popular way of doing this is to get a boat, and travel the rivers
and lakes of the game. Over all, they tend to have more TPs then other
areas.

Some skills, such as **Wilderness**, **Endurance**, **Breath of
Briskness**, **Climb**, **Search**, **Sneak**, **Pick**, and **Swim**
can help with exploring.

## **Areas that tend to be good for TPs**

Some areas are simply visited less often, due to the terrain is
difficult there. They can often accumulate more travel points:

Dense forests, mountains, swamps, areas with alot of random rooms, doors
that are too heavy to open, areas with lots of climbing, areas with alot
of rooms that are no-ride... etc...

Lakes, rivers, oceans, underwater rooms, basically anywhere that
requires alot of swimming. Many players get a boat or canoe and start
hitting up rivers for a way to potentially get 100's of tps! Just watch
your moves so you don't drowned if swimming.

Legend homes can be a places where you can gain some TPs now and again.
Most of them are locked or behind a secret exit. There are legend homes
spread across the Shire, and in some major cities like:

BM, GH, Bree, Fornost, Rivendell

Just think of it this way, if it's a challenge or a pain to get some
where, then players visit it less, and travel points accumulate more!

## **Gear that is Good for TPing**

Most of the following items are things that most lower level players
should be able to either find or buy in a shop.

A water skin and some light weight food. Do NOT travel heavy, because it
can slow you down and make you rest for moves more often. Great light
weight food is elven wafers or bannocks. You can get elven wafers for
free in GH and Lorien. If you don't see any bannocks in a shop, just
narrate and ask if anyone can cook some up for you.

Light sources, lantern and oil, or better yet a red ruby. Good for
exploring caves, tunnels, mines, dungeons, and really dark forests.

Campfires!!! Make a campfire and rest at it WHILE DISMOUNTED, for a
small bump in regen rates. It's good to do this when you are in a
safe-ish area and are tired moves.

Mounts, a **saddle**, and a ranks in the **Ride** skill. If you are
riding alot or long distances, you should have **Ride** skill practiced
over 75%. Many players have it over 90%.

The **mount**s that are good for this are mountain mules or dales ponies
for shorter races (donkeys suck). Ponies are... useable.

Trained horses, war horses, Rohirrim horses for taller races (docile
horses suck). Pack horses are... useable.

Players of the **Rohirrim** subrace gain a bonus to riding and dealing
with mounts. They are great at travelling around multiple zones.

A light pair of boots, that helps out movement. You use movement points
much more efficiently wearing any of these. None of these boots is very
good armour. Examples are:

- black padded boots (the lightest)
- smooth black boots (also a sheath for daggers and knives)
- fine soft leather boots

If you are exploring in areas with alot of snow, **snowshoes** might be
a good idea. Like in parts of the Misty Mountains, or during the winter
months in many zones.

**Rope** can be handy exploring in a group, fine elven rope from a
**quest** in Lorien is the best. This can help players with less
**Climb** skill still get around.

Canoes, rafts, boats, can all help you explore surface water rooms.
**Boating** can use up moves fast. A few rooms in the game have rapids,
and boats can't go down them. Also boats are CRAZY HEAVY and can run you
out of moves pretty quickly.

Several items you can wear on your back help with movement regen:

- Woollen traveller's cloak helps with move regen a little bit (common
  in many tailor and armour shops).
- Forest green cloak, russet cloak, or ragged blackened cloak, all help
  regen moves.
- Some warrior types prefer a imposing, golden mantle, helps movement
  regen.

## **Races and TPs**

See different help files for more information about these races being
able to move, such as:

**help rohirrim, help silvan, help fallohide, help beorning, help troll,
help morrukh**

**Fallohide** hobbits gain travel points more efficiently then other
races, and help can help others in their groups gain travel points as
well. They ignore the small penalty to TPs being shared in a group.

**Stoor** hobbits gain a bonus to Swim skill and Endurance skill,
helping to explore waterways and with some movement point recovery.

**Beornings** gain a bonus to Wilderness skill, which can help you move
around wilderness areas more efficiently, and build campfires faster for
resting next too.

**Dwarves** can carry a heavier load on their shoulders without
exhausting themselves.

**Rohirrim** gain a bonus to Ride skill, which can help riding to new
zones for some tps, it's very effective on roads.

**Silvan** elves can move through some forests more easily, helping
their moves to last longer in the woods.

All **troll** characters require much less tps to level up then any
other races in the game.

**Morruhk** orcs can potentially gain access to slavering warg mounts,
one of the best mounts in the game. Can really help moving around.

## **Storyteller and TPs**

If you gain ALOT of travel points and discover ALOT of secret exits, you
might end up on the traveller's list or explorers list. Just visit the
storyteller in Bree inside the Prancing Pony Inn and:

'ask storyteller travel'

You might also end up on the Explorers list.

**help explorer, view explorer**

It's similar to the warlord list, but for players that have traveled
alot of the map, and while doing so, explored more zones, gained alot of
travel points, and discovered many secret doors.
