This is a good way to start a fight. If you are fighting more than one
opponent, you can switch between them with the command HIT <victim>.

You will experience a short delay after you hit something, its length
depending on how heavy your weapon is.

Example:

\> [hit](hit "wikilink") 2.bear \> [kill](kill "wikilink") \*orc\*
