In order to use missile weapons, you need to wield the weapon, wear the
appropriate quiver, and fill it with the appropriate missiles. After
this, find a target and SHOOT the target. Once the target's dead, you
can RECOVER used missiles.

From time to time, nonmagical missiles will break. This is likely to
happen if you shoot a hard-to-hit target, or when your shot kills the
opponent.

Currently implemented missile weapons are: WEAPON MISSILE QUIVER
