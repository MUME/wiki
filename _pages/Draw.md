Walking about a town with your weapon drawn might draw unwanted
attention from the guards. Play safe, keep your weapon sheathed.

Wearing a sheath, you can use the commands "draw" and "sheathe". Both
commands can optionally be followed by the sheath you want to use. E.g.
"draw harness" could draw a big twohanded sword, while "draw sheath"
could make you use your little longsword.

Example: <nowiki>g

` > draw sheath           (would make you draw the weapon in the sheath)`
` > sheath harness        (would make you sheath your weapon in the harness)`

</pre>

You can also draw bows you are wearing (across your back e.g.) with
"draw <bow>" and weapons in inventory with "draw <weapon>".

If you're wielding a weapon when trying to draw a new one, the wielded
one will be automatically sheathed if there is a free sheath, or hung on
your back if applicable (for bows). If that is impossible, it will be
put in your inventory.
