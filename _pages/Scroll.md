**Scrolls** are powerful items which hold enchantments that can be read
by any character (even [trolls](troll "wikilink")!). Because they are
very powerful, some can be rather difficult to get.
[Orcs](Orc "wikilink") receive an [azure
scroll](azure_scroll "wikilink") from sage for each whitie
[focus](focus "wikilink") they hand in, and can also receive one for
each pbs. If the person reciting the scroll has also learned the
[spell](spell "wikilink") that the scroll contains, the reciting speed
will be greatly increased.

## Types

- [a blue scroll](blue_scroll "wikilink")
- [a black scroll](black_scroll "wikilink")

- [a purple scroll](purple "wikilink")
- [an ivory scroll](ivory_scroll "wikilink")
- [a clear ivory scroll](clear_ivory "wikilink")
