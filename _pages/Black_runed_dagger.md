This is the strangest dagger you have ever seen. It is totally black and

has some very ancient runes engraved on its blade, like the legendary

Númenórean weapons. It is very sharp!

This piercing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is good while attacking and good while defending; its speed is very
fast, and it inflicts considerable damage upon hitting.
