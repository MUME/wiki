**Beornings**, also known as **Bears**, are a race of
[men](man "wikilink") who are capable of transforming into huge,
powerful bears. The most notable and well-known Beorning in Tolkien is
[Beorn](Beorn "wikilink") who appears for his most notable role in *[The
Hobbit](w:The_Hobbit "wikilink")*. Beornings live in the [Anduin
Vale](Anduin_Vale "wikilink"), at the foot of the [Misty
Mountains](Misty_Mountains "wikilink").

## Beornings in MUME

In [MUME](MUME "wikilink"), Beornings are very similar to other races of
men (excluding [Black Númenoreans](Black_Númenorean "wikilink")) except
for their ability to *metamorph* into bears. The following except from
'help beorning' in MUME describes, more accurately, how this ability
works.
(*Following taken from official MUME help*)
In order to change to bear form, use the
"[metamorph](metamorph "wikilink")" command (no arguments). The outcome
is not guaranteed: the chance of a successful change depends on several
factors, among which

- level
- distance from the Carrock
- current mana
- time of day
- moon phase

Bears automatically return to human form after some time (which depends
on the same factors as above). A bear can try to "return" to human form
before the time limit expires; failed attempts can cause fatigue.

While in bear form, Beornings have increased strength and other
"physical" [stats](stat "wikilink"). Their strength, in bear form, is a
near rival for that of [Trolls](Troll "wikilink"). Also, like trolls,
they do not have [mana](mana "wikilink"), and are incapable of using
weapons or spells. Many skills have no effect on the character in bear
form. They use their paws and claws to fight, and their bulk to
[bash](bash "wikilink").
