![](Bear_roar.jpg "Bear_roar.jpg") **Beornings**, also known as
**Bears**, are a race of [men](man "wikilink") who are capable of
transforming into huge, powerful bears. The most notable and well-known
Beorning in Tolkien is [Beorn](Beorn "wikilink") who appears for his
most notable role in *[The Hobbit](The_Hobbit "wikilink")*. Beornings
live in the [Anduin Vale](Anduin_Vale "wikilink"), at the foot of the
[Misty Mountains](Misty_Mountains "wikilink").

## Beornings in MUME

In [MUME](MUME "wikilink"), Beornings are very similar to other white
side [races](race "wikilink") of men, except for their ability to
*metamorph* into bears.

At higher levels, Beornings will preferably fight in their bear form,
unarmed, and with little need for equipment.

Beornings have a bonus on the [wilderness](wilderness "wikilink") skill
(+25% without any pracs) and they are the only race which can [start the
game](pray "wikilink") in the Andiun Vale.

### Metamorph

In order to change to bear form, use the
"[metamorph](metamorph "wikilink")" command (no arguments). The outcome
is not guaranteed: the chance of a successful change depends on several
factors, among which

- [level](level "wikilink")
- distance from the Carrock
- current [mana](mana "wikilink")
- [time](time "wikilink") of day / darkness
- moon phase

Under ideal conditions (high level, max mana, night or darkness, full
moon) bears can metamorph as far as [Bree](Bree "wikilink") or
[Tharbad](Tharbad "wikilink"), but more realistically the range is
[Rivendell](Rivendell "wikilink"), [Moria](Moria "wikilink"),
[Fangorn](Fangorn "wikilink"), and for lower levels limited to the
Anduin Value.

Bears automatically return to human form after some time (which depends
on the same factors as above). A bear can try to "return" to human form
before the time limit expires; failed attempts can cause fatigue.

While in bear form, Beornings have increased strength and other
"physical" [stats](stat "wikilink"):

| STR | CON | DEX | PER | INT | WIS | WIL |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| +4  | +2  | +3  | +2  | -4  | -2  | -4  |

This makes the maximum strength a near rival for that of
[Trolls](Troll "wikilink"). Also, like trolls, bears do not have
[mana](mana "wikilink"), and are incapable of using weapons or spells.
Many skills have no effect on the character in bear form. They use their
paws and claws to fight, and their bulk to [bash](bash "wikilink").

Bears have a special [forage](https://mume.org/help/forage) command
which will provide food and water from the current room.

They also get OB bonuses for being in the same room with other friendly
bears (mobs or players): 1 bear +3ob, 2 bears +5ob, 3+ bear +6ob. This
however only applies for other bears that are either higher level than
the player's character and/or which are legend level.
