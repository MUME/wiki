\> A brigand, looking at your nice purse, is sneaking here.
\> **look brigand**
This tall man stares back at you, waiting for a chance to make his
move.
He has long, slender fingers and he seems to be very adept at using
them
to relieve you of your valuables. Out of the corner of your eye, you
notice a rather large scar running down his neck, partially hidden by
his clothing.
