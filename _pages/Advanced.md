This text is mainly for players who have already played other muds, and
want to skip some of the basic help text. However, since many MUME
characteristics are unique to it, you are advised to read the newbie
help information anyway. This page is also useful as a quick memory
reference for new players.

An example of a command that is very different in Mume than some other
muds is how QUIT works, this difference can be quite a shock if you
didn't read FAQ2.
