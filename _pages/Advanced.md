This text lists some **advanced** commands and terms, mainly for players
who have already played other muds, and want to skip some of the basic
help text. However, since many [MUME](MUME "wikilink") characteristics
are unique to it, you are advised to read the newbie help information
anyway. This page is also useful as a quick memory reference for new
players.

An example of a command that is very different in MUME than some other
muds is how '[quit](quit "wikilink")' works, this difference can be
quite a shock if you didn't read [FAQ2](FAQ2 "wikilink").
