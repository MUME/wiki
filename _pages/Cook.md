If you have a [pan](pan "wikilink"), and there is some sort of fire in
the room, you can [Cook](Cook "wikilink") any raw meat you may have
found. The resulting steak will last longer and be more nourishing.

If you also have some salt in your inventory, the meat will be preserved
for an even longer lapse of time.
