The first people of Middle-Earth, created by Eru Ilúvatar. They are
beautiful and strong, and immortal. Lúthien alone was the only Elf to
have chosen to die from grief and to have left the world, back in the
first terrible days of Arda.

There are now but four enclaves of Elves left in Middle-Earth: the
kingdom of Thranduil in Northern Mirkwood; the Last Homely House of
Elrond in Rivendell; Lothlórien, ruled by Lady Galadriel - the most
powerful Elf remaining in Middle-Earth; and the Grey Havens of Círdan to
the West of the Shire.

Elves usually appear to be both carefree and merry, yet sad and
thoughtful. They enjoy song and poetry, their songs lightening the heart
of many in grief.

As the third age progresses, many Elves have now left Middle-Earth,
returning to their true home in Valinor, no longer concerned with the
troubles of their former home.

## MUME ELVES

Within MUME, Elves are more free to do as they please. They can be found
in any part of the continent, from the Grey Havens to the Misty
Mountains and beyond. Although all MUME races are immortal in a sense,
Elves have the additional benefit of being immune to disease. Although
not as strong as some other races, they are quick thinkers and therefore
make good Magic users.
