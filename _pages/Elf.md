![](Legolas.jpg "Legolas.jpg")''\]\] **Elves** are the first people of
[Middle-Earth](Middle-Earth "wikilink"), created by Eru Ilúvatar. They
are beautiful and strong, and immortal. Lúthien alone was the only Elf
to have chosen to die from grief and to have left the world, back in the
first terrible days of Arda. There are now but four enclaves of Elves
left in Middle-Earth: the kingdom of Thranduil in Northern Mirkwood; the
Last Homely House of Elrond in [Rivendell](Rivendell "wikilink");
[Lothlórien](Lothlórien "wikilink"), ruled by Lady Galadriel - the most
powerful Elf remaining in Middle-Earth; and the [Grey
Havens](Grey_Havens "wikilink") of Círdan to the West of the
[Shire](Shire "wikilink").

Elves usually appear to be both carefree and merry, yet sad and
thoughtful. They enjoy song and poetry, their songs lightening the heart
of many in grief. As the third age progresses, many Elves have now left
Middle-Earth, returning to their true home in Valinor, no longer
concerned with the troubles of their former home.

## Elves in [Mume](MUME "wikilink")

Within MUME, Elves are more free to do as they please. They can be found

Mountains](Misty_Mountains "wikilink") and beyond. Although all MUME
races are immortal in a sense, Elves have the additional benefit of
