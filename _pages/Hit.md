title: Hit

**Hit** and **kill** are [commands](commands "wikilink") that can be
used to start a [fight](combat "wikilink"). If you are fighting more
than one opponent, you can switch between them with the command 'hit
<victim>'.

You will experience a short delay after you hit something, its length
depending on how heavy your [weapon](weapon "wikilink") is.

Example:

`> hit 2.bear`
`> kill *orc*`

Also consider that killing beings who are "[good](alignment "wikilink")"
(innocent citizens, for example) might make you more evil or might also
get you in trouble with the local [justice](justice "wikilink")
officers.
