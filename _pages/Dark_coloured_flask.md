\> **look flask**
The small flask is sealed with an old cork, able to hold some kind of
liquid
within. It seems perfect for storing lamp oil. A small strip of leather
is
attached on the upper part of the flask, so it can be worn on a belt.
\> **con flask**
It is a dark coloured flask.
It weighs a few ounces.

## Other
