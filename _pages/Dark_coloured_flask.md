title: Dark coloured flask
---

\> **look flask**

The small flask is sealed with an old cork, able to hold some kind of
liquid

within. It seems perfect for storing lamp oil. A small strip of leather
is

attached on the upper part of the flask, so it can be worn on a belt.

\> **con flask**

It is a dark coloured flask.

It weighs a few ounces.
