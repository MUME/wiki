**Envenom** is a [thief](thief "wikilink") [skill](skill "wikilink")
that allows you to poison your opponent. First a decent knowledge of the
skill is needed, or you may well poison yourself while preparing your
[weapon](weapon "wikilink"). You must hold a vial of poison in one hand,
and wield your weapon (blade, [arrows](ammunition "wikilink"), or even
spiked mace) in the other hand. You then carefully cover your weapon
with the poison (the command for this is 'poison <weapon>', and it is
ready. The next time that you successfully hit an opponent, he may
become poisoned. The poison will decay on the weapon, however.

Vials of poison can be found in Arda; but as they do not last long, it
is better to learn the [herblore](herblore "wikilink") which allows you
to produce the vials.

Some [races](race "wikilink") are more resistant to the poisons used on
envenomed weapons. It varies of course for each type of poison but
[trolls](troll "wikilink") are immune to the poisons used while
[dwarves](dwarf "wikilink") and [orcs](orc "wikilink") are more
resistant than others.

Example:

`   > poison axe`
