## Envenom

(Thief Skill)

Envenom allows you to poison your opponent. First a decent knowledge of
the skill is needed, or you may well poison yourself while preparing
your weapon. You must hold a vial of poison in one hand, and wield your
weapon (blade, arrows, or even spiked mace) in the other hand. You then
carefully cover your weapon with the poison (the command for this is
'poison <weapon>', and it is ready. The next time that you successfully
hit an opponent, he may become poisoned. The poison will decay on the
weapon, however.

Vials of poison can be found in Arda; but as they do not last long, it
is better to learn the herblore which allows you to produce the vials.

Some races are more resistant to the poisons used on envenomed weapons.
It varies of course for each type of poison but trolls are immune to the
poisons used while dwarves and the orcs are more resistants than others.

Example:

`   > poison axe`
