## Awareness

Awareness helps sharpen your senses (hearing, smelling and vision) to
the point where you are more likely to note suspicious goings-on in your
immediate surroundings. Terrain will play a small part as well in the
sense that you may find it harder to discern movement in a dense forest
than in a cave.

Mastering awareness at your ranger guild can help you see even in the
poorest of conditions.
