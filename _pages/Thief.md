*For the mobile, see [thief (mobile)](thief_(mobile) "wikilink").*

**Thieves** (or 'scouts') are known to have very special qualities that
no other [class](class "wikilink") offers. Many of these qualities can
come in handy in many situations, such as [picking
locks](pick "wikilink").

Thieves can be played in many different ways. You may
[sneak](sneak "wikilink") and [shoot](shoot "wikilink") enemies, doing a
maximum of damage, whilst taking few blows yourself. As you are quite
dextrous, you may also simply [dodge](dodge "wikilink") most hits whilst
attacking with your dagger. Another option would be to
[backstab](backstab "wikilink") your foes while you are
[hidden](hide "wikilink") from their sight.

### Opinion

The most difficult class to play in the game. A thief values
[stealth](sneak "wikilink") over everything and has a lot of difficulty
fighting toe-to-toe with the other classes. Playing a thief takes
patience, luck, and the ability to know when to
[strike](backstab "wikilink")!

### Beginner tips for group play

You can't backstab a fighting opponent, so you're best bets are either
to practice [piercing weapons](piercing_weapons "wikilink"),
[attack](attack "wikilink") and [assist](assist "wikilink") a
[warrior](warrior "wikilink")/buffer/tank with a [piercing
weapon](piercing_weapon "wikilink") that deals decent damage per second
(on aggressive mood), or [assist](assist "wikilink") and shoot, or shoot
from hidden - which involves sneaking into the room, shooting once,
moving out and back in and then shooting again (you'll need good sneak
for this). This will use up more moves, but shooting from hidden gives
you a bonus to your shot. On the other hand, assisting causes [parry
split](parry_split "wikilink") on the target (their [parry
bonus](parry_bonus "wikilink") is divided by the number of melee
opponents), so that also helps both your attack and also all the others
in melee (close) combat with the target. If you are shooting, and
particularly if you are going to sneak in and out of the room, make sure
your fellow group mates know you are going to be doing this, and ensure
your leader (if that's not you) is fine with waiting a few seconds after
kills before moving on for you to recover your arrows. You may wish to
only shoot when faced with stronger opponents to avoid the
[recover](recover "wikilink") delays on opponents that will die quickly.

### Other beginner tips

Backstab does not work well until you have it at very high skill levels,
so don't bother practising it until you're ready to put the maximum
number of practices into it. It's probably not worth using until you're
at least level 18(?) or so. [Missile
weapons](Missile_weapons "wikilink") are a better option until then.

#### Shoot/flee

When playing scout early levels until 16 or so: practice sneak, get bow
and war arrows or ash arrows. Some absorb equipment - fine rigid leather
is a great start. Sneak on, enter room with
[mobiles](mobiles "wikilink"), shoot a mob, flee. Wait for sneak to be
available again (big S in prompt and a message if previously small s in
prompt). Enter again, shoot the mob again, flee. After it dies recover
or get the arrows, repeat for the other mobs. Bows do a tons of damage,
and shoot from sneak is an invisible action, so your first shot often
goes through if you don't get detected by a mob.

#### Alternatives

You could level up to 18 or so practiced and
[equipped](equipment "wikilink") as a warrior/buffer, but with your
thief stats, using [citizen mercenaries](citizen_mercenaries "wikilink")
for parry splitting, retire for 1 month and then get a practice reset
and maybe an age reset. Or train off warrior skills and train up thief
skills when you get to level 16+.

### Other guides

There are better and longer guides out there if you search for them -
either in game (check the [boards](boards "wikilink") and
[libraries](libraries "wikilink")) or in the forums, like [this
one](https://mume.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=5970&sid=b7d0ef4db9c9ab9ad8f057abce07658c#p5970).
