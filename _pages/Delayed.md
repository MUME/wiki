Certain commands need time to perform, such as spellcasting. This pause
is represented by a 'whirling' slash (/, -, \\. Commands which use this
delay have \[Delayed Command\] in the entry.

Many actions are now cancelable while the delay is running by typing a
carriage return. Other input will not cancel and will be handled after
the delay.

Some cancelable delayed commands are:

- [track](track "wikilink"), [backstab](backstab "wikilink"),
  [kick](kick "wikilink"), [bash](bash "wikilink"),
  [reveal](reveal "wikilink"), [search](search "wikilink"), [pick
