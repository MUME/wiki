Certain aspects of the game depend on your **hometown**, such as
calculating [rent](rent "wikilink") costs. Rent costs are lower in
hometowns than other towns. Note! You must be a
[citizen](citizen "wikilink") to get this bonus.

These are the races town officials recognize as being at home:

- [Anduin Vale](Anduin_Vale "wikilink"): Beornings
- [Blue Mountains](Blue_Mountains "wikilink"): Dwarves
- [Fornost](Fornost "wikilink"): Half-elves, Men
- [Grey Havens](Grey_Havens "wikilink"): Elves
- [Lothlórien](Lothlórien "wikilink"): Half-elves, Elves
- [Rivendell](Rivendell "wikilink"): Half-elves, Elves
- [Shire](Shire "wikilink"): Hobbits
- [Tharbad](Tharbad "wikilink"): Men

Darkie officials have no racial prejudices (apart from hatred of
others).
