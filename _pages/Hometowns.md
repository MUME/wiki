Certain aspects of the game depend on your hometown, such as calculating
rent costs. Rent costs are lower in hometowns than other towns. Note!
You must be a citizen to get this bonus.

These are the races town officials recognize as being at home:

Anduin vale: Beornings Blue Mountains: Dwarves Fornost: Half-elves, Men
Grey Havens: Elves Lorien: Half-elves, Elves Rivendell: Half-elves,
Elves Shire: Hobbits Tharbad: Men

Darkie officials have no racial prejudices (apart from hatred of
others).
