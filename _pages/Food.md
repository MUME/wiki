Food and drink are necessary to survive in the long run. Even though one
of the most "unrealistic" features of MUME is that you cannot die
directly of starvation, it's very possible to do so indirectly.

If your character is hungry and/or thirsty his or her regeneration will
slow down a lot.

NOTE: Most food will decompose after a certain amount of time.
