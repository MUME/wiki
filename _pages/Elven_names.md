[Elvish](Elvish "wikilink") names tend to be compound words or phrases.
For Example: [Elrond](wikipedia:en:Elrond "wikilink") means 'Vault of
Heaven', or 'Starry-dome' (El = Star ; Rod/Rond = domed roof). (See
also: '[The Lhamas](wikipedia:en:The_Lhamas "wikilink")' -
[Tolkien](wikipedia:en:J._R._R._Tolkien "wikilink")'s linguistic
dictionary, in [book
five](wikipedia:en:The_Lost_Road_and_Other_Writings "wikilink") of the
*[The History of
Middle-Earth](wikipedia:en:The_History_of_Middle-earth "wikilink")*
series, Part V, Section 2.)

Though it is preferred that you attempt to translate your name into
[Elvish](wikipedia:en:Elvish "wikilink") (see below), it is not
required. However, names that are not translated into Elvish, must then
be in [English](wikipedia:en:English "wikilink")
([FAQ1](FAQ1 "wikilink")), and of course, please attempt to stay with
the adjective-noun format to your name (e.g. Stardome,
[Greenleaf](wikipedia:en:Legolas_Greenleaf "wikilink"),
[Strongbow](wikipedia:en:Beleg_Strongbow "wikilink"), etc.), while
keeping it appropriate, non-distracting, and showing common sense.

Creating Elvish-sounding names from your imagination is, of course,
allowable, but be forewarned, the approximate translation could lead to
embarrassment or simply unintentional inappropriate names (e.g. Glamiel
essentially means [she-goblin](Orc "wikilink") - and would therefore not
be appropriate as a name for an elf).

While members other races have been known to have names of Elvish
derivation, [Dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink"), [Orcs](Orc "wikilink"), and
[Trolls](Troll "wikilink") never have Elvish names.
