## Character names

Elvish names tend to be compound words or phrases. For Example:
[en:Elrond](wikipedia:en:Elrond "wikilink") means 'Vault of Heaven', or
'Starry-dome' (El = Star ; Rod/Rond = domed roof). (See also: '[en:The
Lhamas](wikipedia:en:The_Lhamas "wikilink")' -
[Tolkien](Tolkien "wikilink")'s linguistic dictionary, in [book
five](wikipedia:en:The_Lost_Road_and_Other_Writings "wikilink") of the
*[en:The History of
Middle-earth](wikipedia:en:The_History_of_Middle-earth "wikilink")*
series, Part V, Section 2.)

Though it is preferred that you attempt to translate your name into
[en:Elvish](wikipedia:en:Elvish "wikilink") (see below), it is not
required. However, names that are not translated into Elvish, must then
be in [en:English](wikipedia:en:English "wikilink")
([FAQ1](FAQ1 "wikilink")), and of course, please attempt to stay with
the adjective-noun format to your name (e.g. Stardome,
[Greenleaf](wikipedia:en:Legolas_Greenleaf "wikilink"),
[Strongbow](wikipedia:en:Beleg_Strongbow "wikilink"), etc.), while
keeping it appropriate, non-distracting, and showing common sense.

Creating Elvish-sounding names from your imagination is, of course,
allowable, but be forewarned, the approximate translation could lead to
embarrassment or simply unintentional inappropriate names (e.g. Glamiel
essentially means [she-goblin](Orc "wikilink") - and would therefore not
be appropriate as a name for an elf).

While members other races have been known to have names of Elvish
derivation, [Dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink"), [Orcs](Orc "wikilink"), and
[Trolls](Troll "wikilink") never have Elvish names.

## History

There are 2 Elvish tongues generally used in the *[en:The Lord of the
Rings](wikipedia:en:The_Lord_of_the_Rings "wikilink")*: "the High-elven
or [Quenya](Quenya "wikilink"), and the Grey-elven, or
[Sindarin](Sindarin "wikilink"). The High-elven was an ancient tongue of
[en:Eldamar](wikipedia:en:Eldamar "wikilink") beyond the Sea, the first
to be recorded in writing. It was no longer a birth-tongue, but had
become, as it were, an 'Elven-Latin', still used for ceremony, and for
high matters of lore and song".

"The Grey-elven was in origin akin to Quenya; for it was the language of
those Eldar who, coming to the shores of
[Middle-Earth](Middle-Earth "wikilink"), had not passed over the Sea but
had lingered on the coasts in the country of Beleriand." Eventually,
"their tongue had become far estranged from the speech of the Eldar from
beyond the Sea." In general, the Elves in Middle-Earth "had adopted
Sindarin for daily use; and hence it was the tongue for all those Elves
and Elf-Lords".

Direct quotes are from appendices E and F in the *[en:The Return of the
King](wikipedia:en:The_Return_of_the_King "wikilink")*.
