- This is a general guide with bits of information that are not enough
  for a separate guide. Compiled by Dearth, credit to all contributors
  given in the guide.
- Everything in this guide needs to meet these 2 requirements to be
  included:
  - 1\) **Useful**
  - 2\) **Generally not known**

## PK

## Stats Examples

### Meta PK Stats

In Meta PK section the stats are by players who meet this criteria:

:# This player has a track record(proof as logs) of consistently winning
~equal 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 fights.

:# This person can consistently get warlord \#1 whenever he wants.

:# This person giving advice can keep warlord \#1 for a long time.

- **Elf Mage** (By Snakr)
  - Str:10 Int:19 Wis:17 Dex:11 Con:12 Wil:16 Per:12 (Sancer mage)
    neglect per, improve str
    - Your base abilities are: Str:14 Int:20 Wis:17 Dex:11 Con:14 Wil:18
      Per:11 after training, str ring, wil/con quest
    - 92% sanc(~17dmg sanc cap on WIL 16 recipient), 106% nukes and
      armor, amazing manaregen/sleep/portal. 112% max track
    - Snakr: "per 12 on elf with int 19 wis 17 is enough for 101% nukes
      even with break sanc blind. int 19 wis 18 would overcap armor
      shield quake etc pretty bad, its not worth it even for sancer"
  - Str:12 Int:19 Wis:17 Dex:11 Con:12 Wil:15 Per:12 (Non-Sancer mage)
    neglect per, improve str
    - Str:13 Int:19 Wis:17 Dex:10 Con:11 Wil:15 Per:12 Alternative for
      STR17/18(by Dearth) Train neglect WIL -1 PER -1
- **Elf scout** (By Risneth)
  - Str:15 Int:10 Wis:9 Dex:19 Con:15 Wil:11 Per:17
    - Train neglect PER -3, Train Improve STR +2
    - The point of DEX 19 PER 17 is that both DEX 19 PER 18 and DEX 19
      PER 17 get 109% backstab/sneak- there is a cap. There are probably
      similar caps with spells and warrior skills.
- **Elf scoutmage** (By Cyndane)
  - Str:14 Int:14 Wis:12 Dex:19 Con:13 Wil:11 Per:17
    - Neglect PER, improve STR just over 1, then maintain str and
      improve CON
    - Pracs: Play it as pure thief, until 26. Then get max arm and block
- **Elf scoutmage** (By Greenleaf)
  - Str:10 Int:19 Wis:12 Dex:19 Con:9 Wil:8 Per:18

- **Half-Elf Cleric** (By Breaux)
  - Str:13 Int:18 Wis:19 Dex: 9 Con:11 Wil:16 Per:9
  - Train -1wil str +1. Then per-1 dex +1. Clerics can easily get +3 str
    in neutral zone so in 2nd-3rd age you have STR 18.
    - Alternative for STR 17 with Awlpike: Str:12 Int:18 Wis:19 Dex: 9
      Con:10 Wil:17 Per: 9
      - Train -1 WIL +1 STR. Then +1 CON.
    - Alternative for STR 16 with Durbuk-hai axe: Str:11 Int:18 Wis:19

      bash and about 81% arm/shield or 76% arm/shield
    - Train -2 wis, +2 str, +1 dex

## Skill caps

This is a list of known skill caps. For example, Hobbit endurance cap is
with CON 19 WIL 17 at 120%. In other words, with CON 19 there is no
point getting higher WIL than 17 if you want to max endurance. Another
example: Troll endurance cap is CON 20 WIL 15, which means there is no
point getting CON 21 to max endurance. Important to note: CON 21 WIL 14
does not result in same endurance% as CON 20 WIL 15, it will result in
same endurance% as CON 20 WIL 14.

- Troll Endurance: CON 20 WIL 15 is max endurance 114%.
- Troll Unarmed: STR 20 DEX 15 WIL 15 is max unarmed 104%
- Orc Endurance: CON 20 WIL 15
- Hobbit Endurance: CON 19 WIL 17 is max endurance 120%. (by
  Dostoyevski)
- Elf Backstab/Sneak: DEX 19 PER 17 is max 109% backstab/sneak.
- Elf Armour/Shield/Earthquake cap: INT 19 WIS 17(not confirmed exact
  max %)
- Elf Fireball/Bolt/Spray and other INT,WIS,PER spells: INT 19 WIS 17
  PER 12(not 100% confirmed if PER 13 hits the cap). Fireball rumoured
  to be capped at 110%
- Blind WIS 18 WIL 18 or WIS 19 WIL 17 rumoured to be capped at 110%

## Second Wind

- If your endurance is 100% or more you automatically trigger a fast
  regen of HP when you hit Bad HP(25%).
- Cooldown 24min.
- Here is a graph by Khazdul that shows how much each endurance% regens:
  <https://imgur.com/WYYJVBS>.
  - Sleeping is multiplicative with Second Wind - meaning you can
    multiply these HP numbers with 1.7.
  - *Unknown: Are these effects additive or multiplicative with Second
    Wind: Comfortable buff, fell belt, healing herblore, miruvor for
    pukes, cave troll tunnel HP regen bonus.*
  - *Unknown: How much does being in combat lower the total HP regen of
    Second Wind? Does lowered or increased current CON affect total HP
    regen of Second Wind? What about other effects, like being
    hungry/thirsty?*
- Second Wind always lasts exactly 1 minute, endurance% or anything else
  does not increase the speed.
- Second wind also fills moves
- Level 35 for max endurance.

## Skills

- **Sanctuary**:
  - By Belamir: **Sanctuary does not seem to provide a uniform damage
    cap as previously thought**
    - Testing showed that for the same, single casting of the sanc spell
      on a mother eagle buffer, hits from Old-Man Willow capped at
      "hard", whereas shots from emb/stip capped at "very hard"
    - There is no way hits from Willow weren't hitting sanc cap,
      considering unsancted hits are all (high damage) "extremely hard",
      so this implies that sanc cap scales with the magnitude of the
      incoming damage
    - For both tests, eagle was blind while buffing to reduce defense
      and therefore increase damage; for emb/stip test, eagle was also
      sleeping (same reason)
      - This could offer an alternate explanation: sanc might not be the
        last step in the calculation of damage received
  - The higher the recipient's WIL, the lower the sanc cap. +3
    recipient's WIL is 2.4-2.5dmg difference in sanc cap. The exact sanc
    cap damage numbers will vary on many factors, only the difference of
    sanc cap damage numbers are relevant in these tests:
    - Test 1
      - Sanc 90%, Recipient's WIL: 16, Sanc Cap 18dmg vs Lightning
        Bolt(sample size 10), Sanc Cap 15.9dmg vs Ornate hit(sample size
        10)
      - Sanc 90%, Recipient's WIL: 13, everything else equal, Sanc Cap
        20.4dmg vs Lightning Bolt(sample size 10). We used walking
        herblore to lower WIL -3.
    - Test 2(sanc caster was different, sanc target same, so absolute
      numbers not directly comparable to Test 1)
      - Sanc 93%, Recipient's WIL: 16, Sanc Cap 16.1dmg vs Lightning
        Bolt(sample size 10)
      - Sanc 93%, Recipient's WIL: 13, everything else equal, Sanc Cap
        18.6dmg vs Lightning Bolt(sample size 10)
  - By Woland
    - Warrior using purple on himself results in around 75HP sanc cap
      and cleric using the same scroll on the same target made at least
      twice better. Purple is probably something like 35 on bn and 20ish
      on puke, maybe 17 for max puke cleric with max wil warrior. Max
      puke sanc cap is 12dmg. Max BN sanc cap is somewhere around
      17-19.(By Woland)
  - By Bigger87
    - The purple sanc duration is fixed at exactly 2 minutes 15 seconds.
      This can be used to time the next sanc.
  - Next to test
    - Does current WIS affect sanc cap and how much? AFAIK no wound nor
      herblore decreases WIS so only way to test is: age, train WIS
      neglect or maybe some poison(?)
      - In Fornost behind hidden bookcase is the Alchemist, who makes
        and drops potions at regular intervals. These potions have
        random effects that can include +/- to any stat, including WIS.
        Grab a +/- WIS potion for the caster to test if current WIS
        affects sanc cap. *-Belamir*
- **Transfer**:
  - Someone is pvping in a portable closeable with blacksword or
    charmies, if he starts losing you can transfer him out. Very safe
    because stored teleport can be interrupted by stun powder or bash
    and a rock can resist and is annoying to get.
  - Since minimum mana is 50 you could even transfer 2 people out, or
    even 3 with clearthoughts/cup.
- **Protection from evil**:
  - Extremely annoying interaction with charmies: leading a mother eagle
    and a player will result in eagle always hitting the player. This
    means the spell is quite useless with charmies, unless you're alone
  - The effect of PFE tested by Mr K from Private Wiki:
    - "I let them hit me 100 times with no pfe, 2 pracs of pfe and 12
      pracs of pfe. Below are the average seconds it took them to hit
      me. As the resluts show, the spell is protection from EVIL so it
      has little effect on the neutral crazed. In some rare cases if you
      are leading and grouped, the mob will target the player following
      you, instead of hitting you first."

Protection From Evil

- **Track**:
  - 80% track needed for tracking on ice
- **Armour**:
  - From "help armour": "This spell is less effective the more
    conventional armour you are wearing."
- **Backstab**:
  - Stabbing with mount following gives you way higher fail-rate(By
    Teme)
  - Can't backstab bashed opponent
  - AFAIK the cap is around 260 or 270 hps for 8 damage piercers(by
    Elestir)
  - Better to be in wimpy mood, because backstab automatically makes you
    aggressive, the first hit you receive is as if you were aggressive,
    subsequent hits are as if you're wimpy
  - Rumor: In old news post it was written that mobs and players can
    detect sneaking players by hearing and smell as well. Maybe
    increased weight produces more sound. No idea what would generate
    more or less smell.
    - Same with sneak-shoot???
- **Awareness**:
  - You can see in the dark with exactly 95% awareness
  - Awareness helps to reduce movecost while tracking. How much
    exactly???
- **Charm**
  - Charmed mobs are affected by some but not all worn equipment:
    - They are affected by worn armour (e.g., an orc shaman from Moria
      wearing full metal is a significantly better buffer than the same
      mob without armour worn).(By Elestir)
    - They are not affected by movereduction from boots (according to
      testing by Belamir - Cthulhu says differently)
    - They are not affected by +moveregen equipment such as FGC (from
      Cthulhu and confirmed by Belamir)
    - They are not affected by OB/PB or speed from wielded weapons
    - They are not affected by "eff vs." flags on weapons (e.g., no
      bonus damage to mounted opponents when wielding spears) (Belamir)
      - They can, however, keep at bay using spears - making spears the
        only useful weapon choice for charmies
    - Unconfirmed: are charmed mobs affected by other item flags, such
      as damage/OB bonus flags from enchanted weapons, other item flags
      such as eff vs. spirit from sacred cloak?
  - Charmed mobs are affected by Strength, Sanctuary and Bless spell.
    Sanc caps of some mobs like Huge Stone Troll are better than others.
  - Charm duration is rumored to depend on: your Charm skill %, target's
    level, target's INT, number of charmies currently charmed
  - For a level 15 BN, charm spell costs ~150-160+ mana but is still
    castable. Get a sleeping mountain lion from north vale. Fail 10 time
    or more if u must but the auto bash and power of that charmies is
    out of the world for that level and xp. (Cthulhu)
- **Sneak+Shoot**:
  - When sneak shooting you don't see the sneaker taking aim. Flushing
    can stop it, or if they fail sneaking and you hit them first.
    Loading a xbow will reveal you, so a hitter has to hunt quick.

## Stabbing Weapons

- Stabbing weapons have a powerful keep-at-bay effect, it negates
  opponent's hit completely. First the weapon length is compared, if
  weapon length is equal, keep-at-bay is more likely to succeed if your
  character is tall and the opponent is short.
  - You can make many level 0 characters in account and check their
    height without logging them in with "info <character name>". (By
    Elestir)
    - This is useful even for characters with 0 pracs in stabbing
      weapons like BNs, because keep-at-bay effect is still possible.
  - The tallest races in MUME are Trolls(Enforcer: no height difference
    between hill/cave/mountain) for darkies and Elves(no height
    differences between Silvan/Sinda/Wood/Noldo by Koft) for Free
    People.
  - The tallest that dwarf can be is 5 feet 0 inches(Sample size 80
    characters)
  - The tallest a BN can be is 6 foot 6 inches (Sample size 20
    characters).
  - The tallest a troll can be is 9 feet(By Enforcer, sample size 200
    characters)
  - The tallest elf so far is 6 feet 6 inches (By Koft)
  - Hobbits are shortest and have hard time keeping opponents at bay

## General

- When you rent a mount that has no moves and then immediately "trade"
  this mount has now full moves
- Change Alert Paranoid helps to find random exit names in Emyn, ABR
  mines and Dol Guldur(To be confirmed after search changes, by Nator)
- As puke, you can give OIE Book and Palantiri to Yerik so you don't
  have to find Saruman. Best way to find Saruman: locate life, if
  missing, then he is in Fangorn.
- You can sell spiked metal helmets in Ingrove
- You can check if your characters have good age and have completed
  train neglect/improve with: "account info <character name>"
- Free People safety near Rivendell:
  - Seeking into Rivendell is much faster when the room is lit by sun
    (or moon?).
    - Therefore darkies can make it harder for whities to seek by
      darkening moors.
  - There is a pony at wooden near Rivendell with elven hunters
  - There are climbable water exits near Ohurk that don't freeze at
    winter
  - Looping is no longer effective: Scouts used to be able to make a
    loop and hide so when someone used "track" command, they will
    continue tracking in a loop. Hunter needed to use "where" command to
    see "tracks arriving from west" so he knew target is hidden in room.
    Now they changed it so using "track" or "pursue" tells you that
    tracks are arriving to room.
  - If you approach Elrond on low hps - he can give you infusion which
    will restore you to full hps.
  - Rivendell sortie will sound second horn and leave town at night only
    if first horn was triggered during the day. (By Nator)
- When you pick up infusion from Shire/Hillmen it decays in ~5min.
  Infusion is useful for removing negative effects of any herblore, it
  removes the positive effects as well.
  - Exception is the special effect that prevents spam usage. Such as
    dark draught post-effect. Those aren't purged afaik. (By Elestir)
- To import color scheme/aliases/eqorder from another character: account
  import <character name> colours/aliases/eqorder
- Tharbad Chief can be done without fear of getting locked in: if you
  are in zone during repop, the Chief will not repop and the Chief door
  will not repop. Tharbad will pop but not Chief.(by Elestir)
  - It's just a general rule for partial pops: rooms connected by doors
    always have to pop together. Thats why chief room, 1u, 1n, 2n, and
    2ne all pop together and block pop together. But not nw, because
    there is no door nw. Just like in Luxzum. (by Elestir)
- Spray is better than Bolt vs Unqa, Unqa has some special message when
  Bolt is cast on him, seems to do very little damage.
  - Rumor: Unqa reflects some bolt damage back but doesn't decrease bolt
    damage(like fragile parchment)
- To use the palantir, drop it on the ground and type: 'l palantir
  <dir>

  ', 'l creature <name>'. Most use of it is seek for darkies ;) though
  you must know names of these who are online atm. Don't use palantir
  too much (like more than 10 attempts), or you can get 'bane of Sauron'
  (-5 wil temporary), or even die.
- If anyone has hit-delay (also mobs) their defense is reduced(By
  Elestir):
  - Bulky troll tries to hit u...
  - <delay>
  - You slash troll extremely hard.
- When someone is fighting several enemies at the same time, his
  parrying bonus is splitting (dodging bonus is not though). This is
  called "parrysplitting", and it depends on target's level and the OB
  of those hitting the target. **During delayed actions you don't
  parrysplit.** Includes casting, shooting, bashing.
- If you hit MA, scarred man, doorwarden, experienced assassin or strong
  bodyguard all of these mobs become aggressive to you, until all of
  them (including MA) get killed. MA himself is semi-aggressive by
  default (may attack, but doesn't always do), unless you are invited in
  by the doorwardens (they invite you only if you carry the small silver
  key from Malardil in your inventory). So if you enter his room
  uninvited and he hits you, all becomes aggressive as well.(by Elestir)
- Familiars can carry soft padded boots and transfer them to others so
  you can sneak an extra two or three people in a hidey hole: Give
  padded familiar, Move familiar in to location, Or out, give to second,
  they wear in. You still leave young rat tracks.
- When you give elven meat to wargs they gain moves. Example, kill and
  butcher the elven slaves in Slave pen, south east of Butcher.
- Need 66% Detect Magic to see room key of watch room, portal, teleport
- Killing a lot of neutral mobs will eventually lower align
- Keywords for items, mobs can be combined, ie guard-uruk, shining-shirt

## New character tips

- XP/TP required list: <https://tabris23.tripod.com/help/exp.txt>
- Tips for TP-ing
  - You get most efficient TPs by just visiting zones you've not been
    to, even via roads
  - After that, get a boat(loads on ground near Ingrove) and go on top
    of Anduin Vale and rest, you will go from middle Vale all the way to
    s Lorien except Old Ford room
    - This is the safest spot for everyone because with a boat you can't
      fail swims, you can't be attacked on Anduin and obviously can't be
      tracked
    - When you have rested max moves on Anduin you can go run as far
      away from river as you can for extra TPs, get back on Anduin with
      low moves, rest full and repeat
- Good way to xp as warrior is to get "Average" command and buy a
  parrysplitting charmie from a pet shop such as a falcon or a black
  crow for darkie. Bashes fail a LOT less and you land hits a lot more
  and they have near infinite moves.
- Tharbad citizenship pre level 15 costs 100g
- Concussion weapons are not efficient to XP with, Smiting and Cleaving
  are most efficient, also easier to get good smite/cleave weapons,
  especially claymore/mda.

### Free People

- Get Bree and Fornost citizenship as early as possible. Non-elves will
  be able to get GH/RD citizenship around level 10.
- Do Nordri's quest for Soothing-Draught as soon as possible
  - It's great herblore later because it can stay mixed in your
    inventory for 5h 36min RL
- Travelling quest TP requirement formula(By Elestir):
  - tps_required = max(4000 × level - 37500, 30000)
- "Mossy Clearing in a Small Ash Grove" south GH improves significantly
  HP/Mana/Moves regen
  - There is also a resting stone in Fangorn Forest, near Quickbeam,
    next to the Entwash river.
  - And a resting stone N of the Celebrant river, on the path that leads
    into Lorien.
  - And a regen effect in the Thermal Bath's in Fornost (but you gotta
    pay to visit that one).

## Fangorn

- This section was provided to private wiki by p Kvetak, p Elestir, p
  Belamir
- Camp fire and using lightning or fire spells are crimes that get you
  wanted.
  - Also killing trees with multiple trees in room might get you wanted.
  - Camp fires attract trees to your room.
  - You become wanted for dead with the 5th warning.
  - Re-entering the room with trees gets you wanted faster.
  - Chasing trees can cross water.
- If you are playing a good-side character, only kill trees with keyword
  “**huorn**” if you want to avoid losing alignment.
  - The **giant yew** (lvl 20, beauty), **tall ash trees** (lvl 20,
    balanced), **black alder** (lvl 20, beauty), **haughty elm** (lvl
    19, beauty), **mature linden** (lvl 18, balanced), **ancient oak**
    (lvl 18, balanced) have “**huorn**” keyword, and are safe to kill
    without any drop in alignment.
  - The **slender hornbeam** (lvl 20, Balanced+) and **tall scots pine**
    (lvl 20, Balanced+) are very slightly good aligned, so you can kill
    quite a few before you visibly see your alignment drop.
  - The **imposing beech tree** (lvl 19, Well-meaning) and **birch
    trees** (lvl 19, Well-meaning) are significantly good aligned, so do
    not kill them unless you want to spend a lot of time fixing your
    alignment. (The same goes for the named Ents, obviously.)
- For BNs, do not try to solo Beechbone, Treebeard, or Leaflock.
  (Treebeard required 68 fireballs and a bit under 2 hours for me,
  yielding approx. 160k xp (by Scad))
- Some trees switch, and most are not bashable. All trees have a mudlled
  bash attack which can damage your sword and shield, and can make you
  unwield/remove them.
- There is exactly one tree in Fangorn that you can kill without any
  risk of getting wanted. A bit northwest of the Ford in the River
  Limelight (at the northern border of Fangorn), there is a hidden exit
  north named 'foliage.' Behind this is one black alder tree mob, one
  black alder tree item, and a clump of roots. This tree seems to be
  outside the 'justice' system of Fangorn.
- Try not leave tracks in trackable spots even in Fangorn, for example
  bn scout's ~only advantage is to stab in Fangorn

## Equipment

- Up to date Identify information: <https://krydos.com/mume/>
  <http://faine.epizy.com/?i=1>
- To calculate minimum strength for weapons(By Fieldy): For 1-handed it
  should be weight from identify/15 and for 2-handed weight from
  identify/22,5 - calculation show how much STR weapon needs.
- Spiked metal helmet has +0 OB and -1 DB. Great helm has -1OB +0DB, so
  spiked is a better choice for most orc warriors.

<!-- -->

- Supple gloves load on Dolion when you give him Phial from Druidess
  - -1 ob +2pb compared to fine soft leather gloves and better abs
- Objects worn on FEET and eff vs COLD(Snowshoes from Khuzur chest) make
  it easier to move in the snow.
- Eff vs COLD items helps to protect from catching a flu.
- Miruvor can be gained besides by Erestor also from Tethel's quest and
  returning the book from Redhorn. (Source:
  <https://editthis.info/mumepedia/MUME_Supermobs_and_Solutions>)
- Elven dagger- Loads on a corpse in a goblin in troll forest SW of
  Ingrove. May need to talk to the Elven Scout nearby first. Evil
  players can just kill the scout for his (requires dispel magic to be
  usable by evil chars). OR Loads on a captive Wood Elf in Mirkwood.
  Good aligned players should rescue the elf by beckoning him and
  leading him out prison. He will then produce an elven dagger and fight
  for you like a super-mercenary. Killing him without rescuing him will
  not yield a dagger. (Source:
  <https://editthis.info/mumepedia/MUME_Supermobs_and_Solutions>)

## Wristbands (By Nator)

- No more than 1 of these wristbands can be equipped at the same time:
  **Archaic/Tarnished copper wristband**, **Wide silvery wristband**,
  **Slim silvery wristband**, **Black-thorned wristband**.
  - **Black metal wristband** can be worn with all other wristbands.
- **Wide silvery wristband** can't be worn with metal vambraces/chain
  mail sleeves/shining chain sleeves/shining metal **vambraces**.
  - The rest of the equipment can be metal. (**Wide silvery wristband**
    regen works in this case, tested by Nator)
  - This means, a full metal warrior can make this alias to regen moves:
    rem metal-vambraces + wear wide.
- **Archaic copper wristband** and **Tarnished copper wristband** rules:
  - +10 mana (+5 mana with shining mail/mail, +0 mana shining
    metal/metal)

## Missile

- Missile % also increases shoot/reload speed.
  - Max missile is very good if you are shooter class, especally as
    lowbie.
- Ash arrows have the best ob, means they break less less frequently
  when not chanted and they are light, so you can carry 50 in a normal
  quiver.
  - So Emb + (chanted) ash- arrows is the way to go with max missile!

## Mana regen

- From Breaux comment:
  <http://www.elvenrunes.de/cgi-bin/logs/secure/show.m?log=b65125,62169&disc=1&sort=1&snew=1&omode=&all=4&typ=#new>
  - All these percentages are extremely inaccurate because they depend
    on your race, max manapool, I still think they can be useful for
    comparing between each other
  - +1 WIL increases manaregen ~2%
  - +1 INT and +1 WIS increases manaregen ~2%(Can someone confirm???)
    - Breaux: 1 int/wis is 0.4 manaregen and 1 wil is 0.5 manaregen
      point
  - Manaring increases manaregen ~16%
  - +11 Mana through rubellite increases manaregen ~5.1%
    - Same effect can be achieved with wristband from Squaretooth

## Bolt vs Spray vs Fireball

- Fireball
  - Fireball is most mana efficient
  - Orcs are eff vs fire
  - Trolls are rumored to be ineff vs fire(has anyone used "divination
    on troll player???)
    - I am suspicious of this rumor because troll mobs are not ineff vs
      fire except Bathmhurz
  - WOOD flag on mobs means ineff vs FIRE(By Nator)
- Spray(LIGHT spell)
  - Orcs are ineff vs light
    - Notable mobs that are ineff vs light: Bulag, Karcarak, Shaghosh,
      Bathmurz, Necromancer, Ghostly Captain, Wight Noble, Wight Lord,
      Naugrim Spectyre, Wight Captain
- Bolt(50% LIGHTNING and 50% FIRE spell)
  - BNs are ineff vs LIGHTNING \[this is denied by a V+ - is there any
    actual evidence?\]
  - Orcs are eff vs fire
    - There are no mobs that are ineff vs LIGHTNING
    - Fangorn trees have +LR, which means Long Range spells locate,
      summon etc (by Nator)

- Any room with terrain CITY is no-portal, often there are rooms in
  cities with different terrain though, and there one can portal into.
  (By Elestir)
- You can get the room key for a nolocate room by standing in that room
  and casting this spell without argument. Note that if you try to
  locate a creature or player outside of the room, you will fail. The
  locate life key older than 8 hours still worked. Not 100% where is the
  cutoff.
