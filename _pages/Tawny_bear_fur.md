title: Tawny bear fur

\> **look fur**
Warm but light, this fur appears to be a skin of a large, tawny bear.
Its hairs
are thick and light brown at the roots, sand-coloured in the middle and
thin,
light golden at the ends. The former owner of this fur must have been
able to
easily blend with the ground and trees in sunlit forests.
\> **consider fur**
It is a tawny bear fur.
It weighs one stone and five pounds.
