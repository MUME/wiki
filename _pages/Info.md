The **info** command will give you large amounts of information about
your character. If you want only limited information
[score](score "wikilink") or [stat](stat "wikilink") is much better
since they provide less spam.

The info command accepts an additional format parameter that lets you
define your own info command. An example is "info str: %S". For more
information see '[Info Format](Info_Format "wikilink")'

see also: [Score](Score "wikilink"), [Stat](Stat "wikilink"),
[Reroll](Reroll "wikilink")
