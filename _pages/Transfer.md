**Transfer** is a level 14 [cleric](cleric "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). Like [Summon](Summon "wikilink") it will
transfer a creature or player to the location of the caster but unlike
*Summon* the transfer will include the
[equipment](equipment "wikilink").

Wearing a [ring](ring "wikilink") (or collar for shape-shifting
[bears](bear "wikilink")) can protect against being transfered
involuntarily.
