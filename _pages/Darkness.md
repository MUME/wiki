Example: \> cast 'darkness'

From time to time, the Necromancer causes dark clouds to spread from his
fortress of Dol Guldur. These billowing clouds screen off sunlight,
turning even the brightest day into a moonless night; contrarily to the
effects of the 'darkness' spell, these clouds can extend hundreds of
miles from their source, and usually herald increased activity by Orcs,
Trolls and other evil creatures.

It is said that powerful, evil sorcerers can cooperate with the
Necromancer in creating or extending the duration of his clouds. The
details of the rituals involved are a well-guarded secret.
