**Guide to Fortress and Towers**

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

“War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would
devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor
the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only
that which they defend.”

Faramir, JRRT, The Two Towers

This guide is about how to capture, conquer, and control fortresses and
towers for your side of the war.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at: <https://mume.org/help/help_index>

**Bold** words can be looked up in the games help files. Like **help
fortress**.

# **Fortresses**

These are specific, strategic locations in MUME that you can assault,
attack, conquer, and capture for your side of the War. Different
factions can be in control of any fortress at any given time. It could
already be on your side of the war, or had been taken and controlled by
your enemies.

# **Types of Fortress**

Some fortresses are tiny, 2 rooms, others can cover a large area of 12
rooms. Some are very heavily defended bastions of war, others have just
a few guards.

**Tower** - some of the fortresses are towers, and have rooms up and
down vertically. They tend to be 3 or 4 rooms up and down. These are the
most common type of fortress.

**Camp** - some are small camps, or large sprawling camps of many rooms

**Fort** - some seem more like a fort, or actually are one

**Not a fortress** - some areas seem like they would make a good
fortress, but really are not one

These locations cannot be controlled, and always pop or reset with the
same mobs, no capture allowed. They function like any other zones in the
game. Not every strategic bastion can be controlled by all the factions.

examples: Ohurk chief, Brolg's tower, Elf Scout Hideout near Brolg,
Caravanserai s of Warrens

**Well defended** - some fortresses are very heavily guarded, and seem
more like a supermob, and usually require a group

**Barely defended** - some fortresses have a very small garrison of
troops, and can be soloed more easily

# **How to use a Fortress**

Fortresses can be entered by anyone of the faction that controls it. So
if the Fortress is garrisoned by elves, any of the Free Peoples can use
it. To get in, all you need to do is **call** at the gate. They will
open and let you in, and say open if you want back out. Just like city
gates. While inside you never need to worry about casting or
**wield**ing weapons. There are no jails or justice system while inside
a fortress. You can **cast** any spells you need or **whet** your
weapons. But don't attack the mobs if they are on your side, they will
all attack you. Fortresses do not use **citizenship**s, the only
requirement being a member of the faction that currently controls it.

You can use the watchtower, eat and drink, and take any mounts you need.
If it is your faction you can use all the services that fortress has to
offer.

If you are trying to get in, and the fortress is NOT controlled by your
faction, they will refuse to open the gate for you. In some of the
fortresses, you can still try to enter the backdoor, several of them
have one. Or you can break down the gate to get it, say with **bash** or
**break door** spell. Another option is **pick** the gate open... but
that one can be risky. If you enter the fortress, they can close and
lock the gate behind you. And now you are stuck inside with mobs
aggressive to you.

The gateguards of fortresses load keys that do work to unlock the gates.
If you have the key, you can quickly get in or out of a fortress. The
key always work no matter which faction currently has control of the
fortress. Fortress keys are no-rent.

# **Why Capture a Fortress**

There are several reasons to capture a fortress in MUME. Here is a
summarized list of them:

- credit toward earning your position on the view Conquerors list
- gives that area of the map a small amount of more safety for your side
  of the war
- less places for other factions of the war to hide
- a somewhat safer place to rest, regen, and (risky) go afk
- services that are now safely offered to your side of the war
- honestly, many of towers or camps are simply decent selling loot and
  xp
- several have unique commanders (good for trophy and xp)

Some of the services fortresses can offer are:

- food and drink
- mounts, like a pony, pack horse, or hungry warg
- a place to rest, cook, or sleep, some even have fireplaces
- a gate to call at to enter safely, that shuts and locks behind you,
  with gateguards
- a key so you can potentially control the front gate
- rare fortresses even offer mending or an inn or stable to rent at
- access to a mailbox in some
- access to a **watchtower**
- some have simple gear, like torches, knife, water skin, spear,
  barrels, etc...

# **List of Fortresses**

This is a compiled list of fortresses that can be captured and
controlled. It will include some of the services offered at that
fortress, a rough description of where it is located, a back way in if
it has one (several do), name and common abbreviations, and who can gain
control of that fortress. If it says defaults to, that is which faction
the fortress is controlled by after a reboot, crash, or if it has sat
unclaimed for a period of time. Fortresses never sit empty for long.

## Last Bridge Fort (LBF)

- a few rooms north of Last Bridge on Old East Road, E of Brush area, W

  of Brolg

Services: watchtower, called gate, beer barrel, meat

Backdoor: no back door, pretty much too small to have one

Orcs

## Ancient Broken Road Camp (ABR Camp)

If you control this fortress, your faction also gains some mobs that
patrol some sections of ABR as well, near this fortress. This fortress
comes with the largest area of control of any of them and the largest
number of mobs helping your side. Includes a small tower on south side
of the camp.

- near halfway point on Ancient Broken Road, W of the road, S of Brolg,
  N of Khuzur

Backdoor: secret door in basement that needs picked, one of the easier
backdoors to access

Factions: defaults to Dunlendings, Free Peoples, Sauron's Forces

## Dark Tower (DT)

One of the most challenging fortresses to capture, and maintain control
of. It is almost like a secondary town for some of Sauron's minions most
of the time. It has many mobs inside of it, making it one of the most
difficult to capture and hold. A frequent location of battles, PvP is
common in the area.

- NE of Rivendell, W of Goblin Town (NOC), SW of Zorc caves, along a
  trail in the Mountains
- N of Angurboda, grandma troll rent spot (often called filthy)

## Vale Tower (VT)

Often scouted to check control. A frequent location of battles, PvP is
common in the area.

## Lorien Tower (Ferry Tower)

- a few rooms north of Lorien Ferry, east side of the Anduin river

Services: watchtower, called gate, mounts, access to Lorien Ferry

Backdoor: possibly to get in from the Anduin river, but not very easy to
do because of river currents

Factions: defaults to neutral mobs like vines, Free Peoples, Sauron's
Forces

## Lorien Ferry

You can use the ferry if no mobs are alive on it yourself.

Very likely does not count for the Conqueror list.

- south of Lorien on the Anduin river

Services: passage across the river, call ferry from other side if mobs,
mobs will operate the ferry if alive, if you enter the ferry from a pier
you can operate it as well if mobs are dead

Backdoor: you can jump into the river from either pier if the ferry is
not there (not really a back door needed)

Factions: defaults to elves (free peoples can use it), Easterling men
(Sauron's forces can use it)

# **Conquerors**

If you successfully conquer or capture a fortress, you start being
ranked on how good you are at it. It is very similar to the PK war
points system in the game. If you capture one fortress, that's nice but
not very accomplished. However, if you capture 5 or 6 in a short time,
you will likely be categorized as a Conqueror.

Other then earning a place on the top 10 list, the only real benefit is
cheaper rent at a captured fortress. You also gain a special label of
Conqueror on the who list <C>. But you also made the game map over all
safer for your side of the war as well!

Type **view conqueror** in game to see who's currently on the list for
both sides of the war.

See **help conquerors** for more information.

# **How to Claim a Fortress**

Controlling a fortress involves a violent battle! You must kill all of
the enemies within, including things like hungry wargs or any corpse
guardian shadows that might show up. If any enemies are left alive
within you will not gain control of the fortress. If even one target is
left alive the tower will re-pop to the faction most recently in control
of it.

Then you must occupy the tower for at least 8 minutes or so (varies
some, can be longer). If no one from any opposing factions is also in
the area, vying for control for the tower, it will repop with your
faction in control.

If a tower is cleared of enemies, but you do not wait for the requisite
time occupying it, the tower normally reverts to it's default garrison.
That might be goblins, smugglers, Dunlend warriors, or orcs, depending
on which fortress you were trying to conquer. This can often take over
20 minutes.

# **Fortresses and the War**

Fortresses are not the focus of Player Killing (PK) or Player vs Player
(PvP), but they are certainly a feature of it. Many a wounded or lower
level player has found short rest by seeking the slight safety of a
fortress. And many PKers have gathered keys, controlled fortresses, and
gained some map control by keeping fortresses on their side of the war.
It leaves less places for players of the opposing side to retreat too.

Also, some players on any faction of the war often:

- narrate if they have recently claimed a fortress
- narrate if they have left a fortress empty and unoccupied
- track at the gates for a fortress to hunt other players
- narrate about which faction currently controls a fortress
