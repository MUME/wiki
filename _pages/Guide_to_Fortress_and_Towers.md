**Guide to Fortress and Towers**

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

“War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would
devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor
the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only
that which they defend.” – Faramir

JRRT, The Two Towers

This guide is about how to capture, conquer, and control fortresses and
towers for your side of the war.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at: <https://mume.org/help/help_index>

Bold words can be looked up in the games help files. Like help fortress.

Fortresses

These are specific, strategic locations in MUME that you can assult,
attack, conquer, and capture for your side of the War. Different
factions can be in control of any fortress at any given time. It could
already be on your side of the war, or had been taken and controlled by
your enemies.

Types of Fortress

Some fortresses are tiny, 2 rooms, others can cover a large area of 12
rooms. Some are very heavily defended bastions of war, others have just
a few guards.

Tower - some of the fortresses are towers, and have rooms up and down
vertically. They tend to be 3 or 4 rooms up and down. These are the most
common type of fortress.

Camp - some are small camps, or large sprawling camps of many rooms

Fort - some seem more like a fort, or actually are one

Not a fortress - some areas seem like they would make a good fortress,
but really are not one

These locations cannot be controlled, and always pop or reset with the
same mobs, no capture allowed. They function like any other zones in the
game. Not every strategic bastion can be controlled by all the factions.

examples: Ohurk chief, Brolg's tower, Elf Scout Hideout near Brolg,
Caravanserai s of Warrens

Well defended - some fortresses are very heavily guarded, and seem more
like a supermob

Barely defended - some fortresses have a very small garrison of troops,
and can be soloed more easily

How to use Fortress

Fortresses can be entered by anyone of the faction that controls it. So
if the Fortress is garissoned by elves, any of the Free Peoples can use
it. To get in, all you need to do is call at the gate. They will open
and let you in, and say open if you want back out. Just like city gates.
While inside you never need to worry about casting or wielding weapons.
There are no jails or justice system while inside a fortress. You can
cast any spells you need or sharpen your weapons. But don't attack the
mobs if they are on your side, they will all attack you. Fortresses do
not use citizenships, the only requirement being a member of the faction
that currently controls it.

You can use the watchtower, eat and drink, and take any mounts you need.
If it is your faction you can use all the services that fortress has to
offer.

If you are trying to get in, and the fortress is NOT controlled by your
faction, they will refuse to open the gate for you. In some of the
fortresses, you can still try to enter the backdoor, several of them
have one. Or you can break down the gate to get it, say with bash or
break door spell. Another option is picking the gate... but that one can
be risky. If you enter the fortress, they can close and lock the gate
behind you. And now you are stuck inside with mobs aggressive to you.
The gateguards of fortresses load keys that do work to unlock the gates.
If you have the key, you can quickly get in or out of a fortress.

Why Capture a Fortress

There are several reasons to capture a fortress in MUME. Here is a
summarized list of them:

- credit toward earning your position on the view Conquerors list
- gives that area of the map a small amount of more safety for your side
  of the war\]
- less places for other factions of the war to hide
- a somewhat safer place to rest, regen, and (risky) go afk
- services that are now safely offered to your side of the war
- honestly, many of them are simply decent selling loot and xp
- several have unique commanders (good for trophy and xp)

Some of the services fortresses can offer are:

- food and drink
- mounts, like a pony, pack horse, or hungry warg
- a place to rest, cook, or sleep, some even have fireplaces
- a gate to call at to enter safely, that shuts and locks behind you,
  with gateguards
- a key so you can potentially control the front gate
- rare fortresses even offer mending or an inn or stable to rent at
- access to a mailbox in some
- access to a watch tower
- some have simple gear, like torches, knife, water skin, spear,
  barrels, etc...

List of Fortresses

This is a compiled list of fortresses that can be captured and
controlled. It will include some of the services offered at that
fortress, a rough description of where it is located, a back way in if
it has one (several do), name and common abbreviations, and who can gain
control of that fortress. If it says defaults to, that is which faction
the fortress is controlled by after a reboot, crash, or if it has sat
unclaimed for a period of time. Fortresses never sit empty for long.

do

Conquerors

If you successfully conquer or capture a fortress, you start being
ranked on how good you are at it. It is very similar to the PK war
points system in the game. If you capture one fortress, that's nice but
not very accomplished. However, if you capture 5 or 6 in a short time,
you will likely be categorized as a Conqueror.

Other then earning a place on the top 10 list, the only real benefit is
cheaper rent at a captured fortress. You also gain a special label of
Conqueror on the who list <C>. But you also made the game map over all
safer for your side of the war as well!

Type view conqueror in game to see who's currently on the list for both
sides of the war.

See help conquerors for more information.

How to Claim a Fortress

Controlling a fortress involves a violent battle! You must kill all of
the enemies within, including things like hungry wargs or any corpse
guardian shadows that might show up. If any enemies are left alive
within you will not gain control of the fortress.

Then you must occupy the tower for at least 8 minutes or so. If no one
from any opposing factions is also in the area, vying for control for
the tower, it will repop with your faction in control.

If a tower is cleared of enemies, but you do not wait for the requisite
time occupying it, the tower normally reverts to it's default garrison.
That might be goblins, smugglers, Dunlend warriors, or orcs, depending
on which fortress you were trying to conquer. This can often take over
20 minutes.

Fortresses and the War

Fortresses are not the focus of Player Killing (PK) or Player vs Player
(PvP), but they are certainly a feature of it. Many a wounded or lower
level player has found short rest by seeking the slight safety of a
fortress. And many PKers have gathered keys, controlled fortresses, and
gained some map control by keeping fortresses on their side of the war.
It leaves less places for players to retreat too.

Also, some players on any faction of the war often:

- narrate if they have recently claimed a fortress
- narrate if they have left a fortress empty and unoccupied
- track at the gates for a fortress to hunt other players
- narrate about which faction currently controls a fortress
