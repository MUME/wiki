Newbie kits consist of helpful items for young adventurers just starting
out in MUME. Normally a newbie kit will consist of a weapon of some
sort, a shield, some meat and bread, a cup of water and maybe a map of a
nearby city.

In order to receive a [newbie](newbie "wikilink") kit, simply pray to
the Ainur and nicely ask for one. It is not an automatic process so
please do not continue asking right away if you don't immediately
receive a kit. Spam-praying 'kit' is not appreciated; if an immortal is
not looking at the screen, praying ten times does not speed up the
matter.

If the [Ainur](Ainur "wikilink") do not approve of your name, no one
will kit you. Sometimes there aren't any immortals on at all to be able
to grant you your request so be patient.

Young players of the Free People of Arda are able to get a newbie kit as
needed until they are level 5. Normally you can receive only one kit
until you are killed, at which point you can either try to recover the
equipment in your corpse or ask for another kit and try again. Once you
are above level 5 you are expected to be able to ask other mortals for
assistance so no more kits are given unless you have never received one.

Please note that you drop all your items to the ground when you leave
the game by using the "[Quit](Quit "wikilink")" command. In order to
keep your items you have to "[Rent](Rent "wikilink")" at an innkeeper.

Soldiers of the Dark Lord can only receive ONE kit ever, at any level.

[Zaugurz](Zaugurz "wikilink") Orcs do not get any kit at all.
