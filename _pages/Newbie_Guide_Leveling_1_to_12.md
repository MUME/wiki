Newbie Guide Leveling 1 to 12

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

“The Road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began. Now far
ahead the Road has gone, And I must follow, if I can, Pursuing it with
eager feet, Until it joins some larger way Where many paths and errands
meet. And whither then? I cannot say”

JRRT, The Fellowship of the Ring

This guide is about starting a newbie in MUME. I will not be going
through this like a walk through, but a general path to going from level
1 to 12.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at: <https://mume.org/help/help_index>

Bold words can be looked up in the games help files. Like help quest.
