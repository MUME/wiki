**Newbie Guide Leveling 1 to 12**

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo) “The Road goes ever on
and on Down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the Road has
gone, And I must follow, if I can, Pursuing it with eager feet, Until it
joins some larger way Where many paths and errands meet. And whither
then? I cannot say” JRRT, The Fellowship of the Ring

This guide is about starting a newbie in MUME. I will not be going
through this like a walk through, but a general path to going from level
1 to 12.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at: <https://mume.org/help/help_index>

**Bold** words can be looked up in the games help files. Like help
**quest**.

# **Newcomers**

If you have just made a character, and are new to the game, that
character is categorized or flagged as a **newcomer**. Most players just
refer to lower level characters as newbies (sometimes lowbies). As a
**newcomer** you have access to some options to help in learning the
game.

You show up as a newbie to any **Ranger**s logged in. **Ranger**s also
see when you log in.

**Ranger**s are players who volunteer to help out newer players to the
game. Type **who ranger** to see them, if any are logged in.

You can gain more then one **newbie kit** if you happen to die, until
level 5.

A newbie kit is a collection of some gear, equipment, weapon, food, and
drink to help you.

You receive some starting **hints** about the game that pop up as you
accomplish tasks, or are questing in certain areas.

Once you make it to level 13, you are no longer a newcomer. This guide
is written to help you make it to level 12 or 13. With less deaths and
more leveling!

# **Leveling Up**

In order to **level** up, you need to gain **experience points** and
**travel points**. To see how many experience points (xp) or travel
points (tp) you need to level up, type **info** or **stat**.

You can also choose to add the number of xp or tp you need to your
prompt: **help prompt**

As you gain enough xp or tp to level up, you will notice you gain more
hit points, offensive bonus (OB), and **practice** to spend on skills
and spells. Your mana and moves will not jump up as you level up.

The best way to gain travel points is to find secret doors and open
them, explore rooms you have not visited before, and to travel to new
areas or zones you've never been too. There are even a few **quests**
that grant **travel points** if you accomplish the mission.

There are several ways to gain experience points. The most common way is
to **kill** animals, monsters, creatures, and threats (mobs). You don't
even have to kill a enemy, dealing damage to any mobs in combat grants
small amounts of "hit xp" or "damage xp". Almost all **quests** in the
game grant xp. And some rare evil items can grant xp when turned into
certain mobs.

If you do a majority of the quests recommended in this guide, you should
reach level 12 pretty easily.

# **Newbie Commands and Helpfiles**

This is simply a list of many game commands and certain help files that
many newer players would find useful. It is alot of reading, since this
game is very in depth!

Help files have much needed descriptions and information about playing
MUME.

Commands are what you type or input to perform actions or get
information in the game.

Commands: **hints, info, stat, score, inventory, equipment, level**

Help files: **newcomer, basics, FAQ1, features, rules, hints, change
spam, who, rent, help**

`help help, help basics, help hints, help rent, help features`

# **Areas for Newcomers**

The first area of the game you will find is the Gandalf Introduction
quest. It gives you some tips of what game commands to type, in order to
help Gandalf lead you to a village. Just type the commands that are
hinted, and try to do what Gandalf asks you to do. It is very low risk
or no risk introduction to learning the game.

Gandalf will eventually help lead you to Black Hill Village in the
**Tower Hills**, where you now need to figure out what to try first.

After the Gandalf quest, you can try out the rest of the game at your
own pace.

There is a NPC mob there called Maelton who can give you some tips on
quests in the area.

## Tower Hills and Black Hill Village

- Good for levels 1 to 8

The **Tower Hills** area of the game is the most quest dense part of
MUME. Almost all of the **quests** here are designed to help you learn
many of the games commands. **Hints** will pop up as you attempt the to
do the quests. There are also some helpful NPCs that might give you some
tips.

This village offers many services:

- several shops to use: **list, buy, sell, mend, resize, value**
- shops you may find are: grocer shop, herbalist shop, weapon/armour
  (blacksmith) shop, bartender
- Tower Hills has an **Inn** to **rent** at
- and **stable** to use if you have a **mount**
- it has one of every **guild** master in the village or very close by,
  near the village: warrior, ranger, cleric, mage, thief
- the warrior and mage guilds are IN the village, ranger and cleric just
  north of the village, thief is a hunter just SE of the village
- some farms just directly north of the village that have mounts, food,
  and water
- most of the mobs in the area are not very dangerous
- several NPCs in or near the village offer quests with rewards (such as
  the thief and ranger guilds, or herbalist shop)

The rest of the **Tower Hills** area does have an aggressive mob here
and there, but over all should be fights you can get away from, or even
win. There is alot to explore in the Tower Hills and that area along can
keep you busy for several levels (up to level 8 recommended) or entire
play sessions.

## Halls of Mandos

If your character happens to die for any reason, you will show up in the
Halls of **Mandos** basically naked. All of your gear and items will
remain on your corpse in whatever room you died in. To retrieve your
gear, you need to return to your corpse to loot it and get your items
back.

To leave the Halls of **Mandos**, you must wait for your **hit points**
to regen or heal back up to (bad). Then you can **pray** to a town or
city to start your adventures anew. Some towns or cities you might not
be able to pray to yet.

If you just type **pray**, you will get a list of any of the towns or
cities you can be magically transported too.

Also while in the Halls of Mandos, you can magically eat and drink. Just
type **eat** or **drink** in the room, and you will magically be full.

`pray shire, pray tower hills, pray grey havens, pray bree`

## Villages Near Tower Hills

- Good for levels 1 to 8

There are several villages near Tower Hills that are pretty safe to
explore. These villages might have a shop here and there, and some of
them have Inns to rent at. They are all located south of Tower Hills
area, and are fairly easy to reach once you make it to the Road to Grey
Havens.

Inside any of these villages is safe. But there are some dangerous areas
around some of the villages.

Over all traveling along the main Road is pretty safe for anyone that is
not naked and not level 1.

- Elven Wine Village

North of the Road to Grey Havens, south of Black Hill Village. Has food,
drink, mounts, some gear. No city gates, you can just walk in and
explore.

- Aldereon's Village

North of the Road to Grey Havens. Has an inn, food, drink, bar, some
gear, mounts. Outside of the gates you can just type **call**, and the
guards will open them for you.

- Elven Valley Village

South of the Road to Grey Havens and hidden, so it's harder to find. Has
some water and is a safe place to explore and rest. Outside of the gates
you can just type **call**, and the guards will open them up for you.

- Greenholm

This is the furthest west Hobbit village, and is outside the Shire. It
has an inn, stable, a shop, and a bar. No city gates, you can just walk
in and explore.

- Safety warning!!!

Beware the patches of forest in between Aldereon's Village and
Greenholm, north and south of the road, many aggressive mobs there.

- Those forests areas are more for level 7 to 13

## Shire

- Good for levels 1 to 8

This is a very large area with multiple villages and a town spread out
across several zones of the game. Over all the entire Shire is safe to
explore. Most of the **guild**s there are for hobbits only. But you can
still use any of the shops, **stable**s, **inn**s, or other services.
Food and drink are common and easy to find in the Shire. Fair warning,
however, if you are not a hobbit:

You can **wield** weapons in the Shire and not get arrested. But do not
attack any of the hobbits there or **cast** any spells there. You will
be wanted and get thrown in **jail**.

## Grey Havens (GH)

Grey Havens is actually two cities split by a large bay of the ocean.
Both Harlond and Forlond are save to explore at any level.

The Haven of Harlond is closest to Tower Hills and fairly easy to get to
following paths or roads. The city has magical gates that will just open
up for you to enter. There are shops, an inn, stable, and one of every
**guild** in Harlond to **practice** at. A great town to explore and
look around.

To get to Forlond, you'll need to catch a ride on the ferry that crosses
the bay. For low level characters (below lvl 5) the ferry is free.

However, you need to not **cast** any spells in town or **wield** any
weapons, or they will arrest you and put you in **jail**. Once you
become a **citizen**, you can wield and cast at any time.

So remove weapon before you enter the town.

## Villages and farms near Grey Havens

- Some spots are lvl 1 to 5, other areas are more lvl 6 to 10

South of Grey Havens there are 2 elf villages that offer a few services
and also some farms. There are a few tough mobs that wander that area
(boars, snakes, etc) so explore with some caution. If you are getting
comfortable with some of the games commands, this can be a good area to
explore some.

No city gates, you can just walk in and explore any of the farms or
villages.

## Bree and it's Villages

- Good for levels 5 to 12

Bree is a great town to explore. It has inn, stables, many shops, food,
drink, and some gear. There are also 3 small villages just NE of Bree as
well, Staddle, Archet, and Combe. The town and the villages are safe to
explore, but the area surrounding them can be more dangerous. Beware
traveling too far east of Bree at lower levels.

However, you need to not **cast** any spells in town or **wield** any
weapons, or they will arrest you and put you in **jail**. Once you
become a **citizen**, you can wield and cast at any time. They will also
not open up the city gates at night if you are not a citizen.

## Farms

- Good for levels 1 to 8

There are many farms in the game, and they are great for new players to
look around. There are farms near Tower Hills, Grey Havens, Shire, and
several around Bree. If you find a farm try and remember where it was
at, so you can return if you need to. Most farms in the game have food,
water, and maybe some gear and mounts. They also often have weaker mobs
you can try your combat skills on. Don't worry about being arrested on
farms, it's safe to kill the cows and other animals you find there. You
can also take any mounts from farms.

# **Areas for Newbies to Avoid**

There are some locations that are quite dangerous for newbies to enter.
Often because of more difficult mobs but sometimes because the zone
itself is a maze, maybe with random exit rooms. Here is a list of spots
you might want to avoid to live longer... and maybe return later to over
come their challenges. Some of these areas are suitable for level 17-20,
many are level 21+.

### Old Forest

- SE of Shire
- Visit after level 16

There are groups of strong trees and roots that ensnare you. A classic
place where new players often die. It also has many random exit room
exits, so it is very difficult to get back out and is very easy to get
lost. It does have a feature to help out players trapped inside. Just
tell Tom help and Tom Bombadil will come to rescue you. Just follow him
and he will lead you out.

### Barrow Downs

- SW of Bree
- visit after level 16

An old stronghold of the Witch King, it has some undead that can't wait
for you to join them and a very powerful supermob with undead allies.
The map is also extremely confusion, and easy to get lost for a long
time inside. It does have a feature to help out players trapped inside.
Just tell Tom help and Tom Bombadil will come to rescue you. Just follow
him and he will lead you out.

### Old Fornost

- directly west out of Fornost NW gate
- visit after level 16

This is part of the ruins of Fornost after the Witch King's army siege,
surrounded, and a attacked it ages ago. Left behind are several
challenging undead.

### Blue Mountains Mines

- access on the south side of the upper level of Blue Mountains
- visit after level 18

This is a confusing mine maze that changes it's map every repop. It has
some very sneaky spiders that can trap you in a cocoon of webs. They do
eventually eat you later... Very risky solo if you don't have someone to
help cut you out of the web cocoons.

### Brush

- 2 zone area on Old East Road a few zones E of Bree
- you can pass by this area on the Old East Road at lower levels, but
  avoid going inside until after level 12

This area is out side of the protection of the Hardened Rangers that
patrol and defend Bree. It has some strong weeds, spiny bushes, lions, a
pack of patrolling orcs, raiders that run to assist each other, and
other challenges. Also players of Sauron's Minions travel here
frequently.

### Tharbad

- South on the Greenway and the Road to Tharbad, can also access with
  the Grey Ship from Grey Havens, and the Coach from Bree/Fornost
- Best to wait until after level 6 at least

This is one of the major cities of the game, but that often lets newbies
think it is safe like the other major cities. It is not. Tharbad is a
pretty lawless city of thieves, muggers, bandits, and assassins. Even
the gateguards will attack you. The sewers full of smugglers and other
criminal elements. Also Black Numemoreans can enter the city at any time
and Orcs often track up to the gates.

The city gates close at night, so it is very easy to get locked inside
this town. The Grey Ship from Grey Havens or the Coach from Bree/Fornost
can still take you back out. Might be safe to carry a spare coach ticket
or 2, buy them in shops in Bree, Fornost, Mewlip Inn, Jasper's Tavern.

You can wield weapons in this town and cast spells, and will need to do
that in order to survive.

### Dunland

- far south of Rivendell and far east of Tharbad
- you can probably travel through the area after level 12, with a mount
  and good gear

This LARGE region over all isn't all that dangerous after newbie levels,
BUT it does have areas in it that are difficult. There are multiple
villages of Dunlendings with warriors, captains, and even supermobs. If
you avoid those villages and stick to the plains, you might be safer,
but beware the sneaking hunters, trappers, and huntsmen.

### Mirkwood

- 3 sections, North Mirkwood, that is North of Ingrove
- Old Forest Road and Emyn Fuin further east, South of Ingrove
- a portion of Mirkwood that is outside of Dol Guldur, Sauron's
  stronghold in this age

All 3 sections of Mirkwood are very challenging, even after level 20.
Very strong trees, vines and fungi that can poison, werewolves,
encampments of orcs, and spider webs to entrap you.

### Trollshaws

- W of Rivendell, E of Brush, N of the Great East Road
- you can pass by this area on the Old East Road at lower levels, but
  avoid going inside until after level 16

This is where the Troll Warrens is located, and several dark patches of
dense forest where trolls live. Players of Sauron's Minions visit and
track in this area often. If you need to visit, travel as quickly as you
can along the road, and try to do it in daylight.

### Ancient Broken Road

- S of Rivendell
- you can probably travel through the area after level 12, with a mount
  and good gear, best to avoid the fights

This area is commonly tracked and patrolled by Sauron's Minions. There
are cave networks of trolls and goblins.

### Moria

- middle of Misty Mountains, west gate is closed, east gate is open
- challenging, avoid until after level 21

The fabled Mines of Moria have great risks and great rewards. It is one
of the most high level and difficult areas of the entire game.

# **Quests By Area**

This section is not a quest walk through, but more of a general guide
for what quests you should be attempting if you find them. This will be
a list of the areas where you can get these quests, and which mob or NPC
offers them.

Quests very often grant some xp as a reward. A few quests can grant tps.
Many quests can also come with other possible rewards, citizenships,
silver coins, gear you can use or sell, knowledge in languages, and even
more!

To accept a **quest** from a mob trying to give you a quest, you often
need to:

**nod**

**say yes**

That means you've accepted the quest. Also check your **quest** log to
make sure the quest is actually there.

Some quests have a scaling difficulty and will be easier or faster at
lower levels. They progress to become more challenging as you level.
Other quests are the same, no matter what level you try them on.

## Tower Hills and Black Hill Village

you'll easily be level 5. And you'll be more prepared to take on

# **Mobs By Level**

This section is here to help you find fights you can over come, and
maybe avoid fights that could end up leaving you awful or dead. It is
simply a list of mobs of different types (birds, snakes, spiders,
animals, plants, etc...) that you have a good chance of being
victorious.

These lists are just a place to get started, there are MANY more mobs
that would also fit into these level categories. And some types of mobs
vary by the region you are at in the game.

You can, of course, fight any mobs you want too. But you might lose a
**citizenship** in town or be thrown in **jail** if you attack any
citizens. I would recommend not attacking 'citizen' like mobs, such as
dwarves, elves, hobbits, most men, farmers. If you kill good aligned
mobs, it will drop your alignment which could restrict what cities or
towns you can enter. And some mobs in the game might start hunting you,
such as elven hunters.

If you have been trying to upgrade your gear, you will notice it can
help make these fights easier or faster.

If you have been spending your **practice** wisely at guilds, you will
notice it can help make these fights easier or faster.

Some of these mobs might be easier for certain classes. A warrior with
good weapons and armour might find some of these earlier battles a
little easier or faster then a mage or a cleric.

Some of these mobs might have a 'special attack' like bash, a poisoned
bite, backstab, or kick. The more you battle with them, the more you
will learn some of their tricks.

Beware trying to take on groups of mobs, they will split up your
**parry** PB bonus between them, meaning they will all be able to hit
you more often. But once you are a couple levels higher, taking on a
group of 3 large bats should not be much of a problem. One of the
easiest ways to make lower level weaker mobs more challenging is to just
add MORE of them.

If you are worried about a fight, please use these 3 commands to help:

- **consider** - this compares the fight to your level, and gives you an
  estimate if you might win or not.

If it sounds too hard of a battle, that means the fight probably is, and
you'll end up fleeing or dead.

- **scout** - this allows you to peer into the room ahead, so scout n,
  scout d, scout w, etc... some exits are not scoutable.

<!-- -->

- **flee** - if you are getting hurt, wounded, bad, or awful quickly,
  you should probably **flee** from the fight

Please be aware, that trying to scout a oneway exit, will make you
automatically move in that direction. This can be dangerous and has
killed a few characters.

`flee, scout e, scout d, scout n, con fish, con bird, con insect, con wolf, con spider`

## Level 1-4

One issue you will find with some of these lower level mobs is that they
really like to **flee**! Most of them are non-aggressive. Some ways to
over come this issue is to use a missile weapon, cast a spell at them,
or be a warrior with as high of an OB as you can get. Another warrior
trick is to bash those fleeing mobs, and when they flee from you they
are very often still bashed in the next room they fled too.

garden snake, tiny spider, all rabbits, most birds (sparrow, finch,
lark, duck, chicken, etc) fox, pig, sheep, boar cub, wolf cub, cows,
deer, small bat, mouse, most fish (bass, carp, trout, etc..) swarms of
mosquitoes, sand viper, slithering snake, bees, grasshopper, butterfly,
worm, squirrel, opossum, otter, marten, raccoon, rooster, young ruffian,
small leech, goat, goat kid toad, frog, bullfrog, swarms of midges,
small brown snake, beaver, catfish, vicious rat, bloodthirsty bat

## Level 5-7

stag, elk, bull, ancient fungus, grey wolf, ruffian, bandit, large bat,
animated skeleton, mother wolf, earth beetle, giant rat, great rat,
brown snake, black snake(p), black wolf, half wolf, black raven, swarm
of hornets(p), small tangle of roots, tusky boar, water snake(p), forest
spider(p), water spider,(p) tree-snake(p), billy goat, porcupine, large
pike, large mother hawk, ram, water moccasin(p), wolverine small tangle
of roots

Be aware some few of these mobs can poison you. They are marked with a
(p).

At these lower levels, the poison is not very strong, and will not last
for very many game hours.

## Level 8-10

boar, roots, tangle of vines, white wolf, huge black wolf, black fungus,
huge bat, giant termite, queen bee(p), brigand, thief, footpad, dreadful
snake(p), green snake(p), wild bull, huge spider(p), young mountain
lion, mastiff, wild dog, rabid grey wolf, starved grey wolf, old bull,
starving bear, sturgeon, bandit bodyguard

Be aware some few of these mobs can poison you. They are marked with a
(p).

## Level 11-13

You may need to rest, recover, and regen for hit points after these
fights, don't try them starting out at wounded either... Maybe build a
campfire to rest next too.

robber, thick vines, mottled snake(p), pack leader wolf, brown bear,
haunt, spirit, smuggler, black widow spider(p), giant lizard, black
bear, mugger, thug, giant slug, ferocious warg, hungry warg, shifting
shadow, spirit slave, lioness, giant green fungus(p), raiders, brushmen

Be aware some few of these mobs can poison you. They are marked with a
(p).

## Mobs to Avoid... for now

Some mobs are going to be a serious threat to your characters life. I
really recommend avoiding such mobs if you are below level 13. There is
good chance you may end up dead, or fleeing at bad or awful hits as you
painfully learn your lesson. These are difficult for many reasons such
as: high OB (hits more often), high damage (just hits hard), bashes, has
strong poison, can track down if you flee, or are simply higher level
then you are. Try to use the scout command to avoid doing battle with
some of these mobs. huge tarantula, rattlesnake (high OB, very strong
poison) assassin (high OB, backstab) mountain lion, crazed dwarf (high
OB, bashes) dark wraith (good DB, casts lightning bolt) grizzly bear,
vulture, great werewolf, shade (higher level, higher damage) chief
smuggler (higher level, parry splitting allies)

There is much more information available in the hints command (just type
hints in game), help files, and the many other guides on this Wiki. And
you can always ask in the narrate channel in game for help with any
questions as well.
