title: "Great Eagle"
---

Once a character creates a [focus](Focus "wikilink") item they have the
option to call an eagle.

Eagles are special mobs that arrive from the sky and can transport
players over huge distances off the map.

To call an eagle use:

`> call eagle`

Once you call the game will show

`> You look up towards the skies and start calling the mighty creatures.`

Calling will take most of your [movement
points](Movement_points "wikilink").

Eagles can only be called outdoors and in rideable rooms. Also they
don't like to come too close to towns.

After you call an eagle, it may take 90 seconds to 2 minutes for it to
arrive. If it has not arrived then, calling has failed. There will be no
message by the game to tell you so.

Once you have called an eagle, there is a cooldown period where you
cannot call again and the game will tell you if calling to quickly
again.

Once the eagle arrives, you can type

`> ride eagle`

and then to tell the eagle the destination:

`> whisper eagle rivendell`

You have a limited time to climb and tell the destination. Otherwise the
eagle will leave again.

The distance you can fly is limited and is somwhere in the order of
Lorien to Last Bridge. Silvan [elves](Elf "wikilink") have a special
perk which extends this range.
