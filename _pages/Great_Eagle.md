title: Great Eagle
---

Once a character creates a [focus](Focus "wikilink") item they have the
option to call a Great Eagle.

Great Eagles are special mobs (not related to the 'Eagle' or 'Mother
Eagle') that arrive from the sky and can transport players over huge
distances.

To call an eagle use:

`> call eagle`

Once you call the game will show

`> You look up towards the skies and start calling the mighty creatures.`

Calling will take most of your [movement
points](Movement_points "wikilink").

Eagles can only be called outdoors and in rideable rooms. Also they
don't like to come too close to towns.

After you call an eagle, it may take somewhere between 90 seconds to 2
minutes for it to arrive. If it has not arrived then, calling has
failed. There will be no message by the game to tell you so.

Once you have called an eagle, there is a cooldown period where you
cannot call again and the game will tell you if calling too quickly
again.

Once the eagle arrives, you can type

`> ride eagle`

and then to tell the eagle the destination:

`> whisper eagle rivendell`

You have a limited time to climb and tell the destination. Otherwise the
eagle will leave again.

Possible destinations are: Rivendell, Nen-i-sul, Ost-In-Edhil, Lorien,
Last Bridge, Tharbad, Bree, Fornost, Anduin, Weathertop, Shire, Grey
Havens, Blue Mountains, Khuzur, Moria, Dunland, Rohan, Fangorn, and
Isengard.

The distance you can fly is limited and is somwhere in the order of Last
Bridge to Lorien. Sinda [elves](Elf "wikilink") have a special perk
which extends this range. If the distance is too far for the eagle to
fly, it will tell you and let you chose a different destination.

The travel will happen off the map (you will see your X moving the
direct path even if outside of built zones) and you'll be above the
clouds and cannot see rooms while the eagle is in the air.
