\> **examine blackscroll**
This scroll is an unevenly cut piece of coal-black parchment covered by
thin,
silvery letters. The fragile parchment has the look of a scorched leaf
that
would crumble if not for the mesh of silvery veins holding it
together.
\> **consider blackscroll**
It is a black scroll.
It weighs half a pound.

## Opinions

The same healing effect of a [blue scroll](A_blue_scroll "wikilink") but
with a [strength spell](Strength_Spell "wikilink") included. Definitely
the most difficult type of healing scroll to attain.
