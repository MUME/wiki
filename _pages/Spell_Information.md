If you want a list of all spells, visit this [Spell
List](Spell "wikilink")

Technical information on each spell is shown in this manner: Syntax :
What to type to make the spell work properly. Accumulative: If the spell
is accumulative or not. Duration : If the spell has a duration or not.
Position : In what positions you can cast the spell. Example : An
example that should work if you just cut/paste it. \[victim\] means that
an argument is possible, but not at all times necessary. <victim> means
that an argument is always required.

Offensive spells (generally) need an argument only if the caster is not
engaged in combat.

You may also ask a guildmaster about these spells, and if he is
sufficiently skilled, he will tell you more about them.

Some spells are castable on self by default (with no argument), these
are: [Armour](Armour "wikilink"), [Bless](Bless "wikilink"), [Cure
Blindness](Cure_Blindness "wikilink"), [Cure
Critical](Cure_Critical "wikilink"), [Cure
Light](Cure_Light "wikilink"), [Detect Evil](Detect_Evil "wikilink"),
[Detect Invisibility](Detect_Invisibility "wikilink"), [Detect
Magic](Detect_Magic "wikilink"), [Detect
Poison](Detect_Poison "wikilink"), [Heal](Heal "wikilink"),
\[\[Shroud\],_\[\[Protection_From_Evil\|Shroud\], [Protection From
Evil](Protection_From_Evil "wikilink"), [Remove
Curse](Remove_Curse "wikilink"), [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"),
[Strength](Strength "wikilink"), [Word of
Recall](Word_of_Recall "wikilink"), [Remove
Poison](Remove_Poison "wikilink"), [Sense Life](Sense_Life "wikilink"),
[Cure Serious](Cure_Serious "wikilink"), [Night
Vision](Night_Vision "wikilink"), [Shield](Shield "wikilink").

You cannot cast a spell when you are of a level lower than the minimum
to learn it from a guildmaster. Hence losing a level can result in the
loss of certain spells, rather than a greater mana cost.
