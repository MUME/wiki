There are many boards about Arda. Each board has a different purpose, as
given by its name.

A summary of boards features:

<nowiki>g - 'look at board' or 'look board' shows only unseen
messages. - 'look whole board' shows all messages (seen are marked with
a '+'). - 'look whole board by <player name>' shows all messages by
someone. - 'look threads' shows all message threads. - 'look all
threads' shows additional information on message threads. - 'look thread
<number>' shows all messages belonging to a certain thread.

\- 'write

<title>

' lets you write a new message. - 'reply <number>

<title>

' replies to an existing message.

` If you omit `<number>` you reply to the last read message.`
` If you omit `

<title>

your message will have the same title as the message you

` are replying to.`

\- 'read next' displays next unseen message (better use that than 'read
<num>'). - 'read last' rereads the last message that you read. - 'read
forward' reads the next reply to the last message you read.

\- 'read thread <number>' reads the first message of a thread. - 'read
thread <number> next' displays next unseen message in thread. - 'read
origin' reads the first message of the current thread.

\- 'mark <number>' marks a message that you want to remember.

` Such messages are still displayed by 'look board' even if they have been read`
` (they are marked with a '*' after the message number).`
` You can use 'unmark `<n>`' to remove the mark.`
` You can also do 'mark last', or 'unmark last'.`

\- 'catchup <number>' marks all the messages up to <number> as seen.

` If `<number>` is omitted, all the messages are marked as seen.`

\- 'catchup thread <number>' marks all messages in thread as read.

` If `<number>` is omitted, you mark all messages in the current thread.`

\- 'reset' clears your memories of a board, marking all messages as
unread.

\- 'remove <number>' will remove a message you have posted.

</pre>

Messages marked with a '#' won't be removed by time update.

If you use "view" instead of "read", you will get a copy of the text in
your editor. Note that you can't change the actual text on the board.

If you try to read a message but you can't see anything, or get an
"infinite loop" error, it is very likely that you have too many unread
messages. Type "catchup" and then read the messages with "read
<msg number>".
