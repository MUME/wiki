title: "Newbie Guide to Choosing your Base Abilities or Stats"
---

This is a basic and simplified guide to how and why you should choose
what values for your characters base abilities depending on what class
you want to become. As such it is mostly aimed at helping those new
players that prefer to choose their own stats (over using the pre-made
stats, which are good in most cases) avoid making big mistakes when
choosing the base abilities.

Example: A mage with 8 WIS works fine in D&D based systems but won't be
a good mage in MUME, it will in fact be a very poor mage.

The ranges are based on the character being a human, so for other races
modify the ranges with the race modifiers; or don't and get a less
specialized but likely more all-round character.

Mage:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|                                                                    |           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| STR: More the heavier armour you want to be able to use.           | \[10-13\] |
| INT: MAX. You can never have more than enough INT as a mage.       | \[18\]    |
| WIS: Quite high, though max is good it is far from essential.      | \[16-18\] |
| DEX: You want some, but much won't help you much at all.           | \[10-13\] |
| CON: Can help a lot, but not allways as much as you might think.   | \[10-14\] |
| WIL: Some. If you want charm/sleep to work well get it quite high. | \[14-17\] |
| PER: Some.                                                         | \[11-14\] |

Cleric:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|                                                                         |           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| STR: More the heavier armour you want to be able to use.                | \[10-13\] |
| INT: Max, but if really needed you can drop it a little.                | \[17-18\] |
| WIS: Max.                                                               | \[18\]    |
| DEX: Some is good, but you can get away with very little with high WIL. | \[8-12\]  |
| CON: Can help a lot, but not allways as much as you might think.        | \[10-14\] |
| WIL: Very high, MAX isn't needed but helpful at least on lower levels.  | \[16-18\] |
| PER: Enough to get as much track as you want.                           | \[8-11\]  |

Warrior:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|                                                                        |           |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| STR: If you want to be able to use good damage weapons get 18.         | \[17-18\] |
| INT: Enough to together with PER get as much track as you want.        | \[8-12\]  |
| WIS: Not much use, unless you want a lot of leadership.                | \[8\]     |
| DEX: You really want some, and possibly very high.                     | \[13-18\] |
| CON: The most important stat for most warriors.                        | \[17-18\] |
| WIL: The more the better, but you can't get everything and some is ok. | \[13-17\] |
| PER: Enough to get as much track as you want.                          | \[8-14\]  |

Scout:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|                                                                         |           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| STR: Will help you carry more, so get some and more if you can.         | \[14-16\] |
| INT: Not much use, but can put leftover points in it.                   | \[8-10\]  |
| WIS: Very little use, so don't waste points on it.                      | \[8\]     |
| DEX: Primary stat for scouts, so get max.                               | \[18\]    |
| CON: Will decide how mobile you are, so get as much as you can.         | \[15-18\] |
| WIL: Helps some, but can mostly be compensated for so most keep it low. | \[10-14\] |
| PER: Important to get scout skills high. Pure scouts work with less.    | \[16-18\] |
