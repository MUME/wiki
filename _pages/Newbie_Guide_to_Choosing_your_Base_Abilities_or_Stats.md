title: Newbie Guide to Choosing your Base Abilities or Stats
tags: ["Guides", "Newbie Help"]
---
This is a basic and simplified guide to how and why you should choose
your base abilities for different classes. As such it is mostly aimed at
helping those new players that prefer to choose their own base abilities
to do so in a way that they can avoid making any big mistakes that would
be impossible to correct in the future. You can do a limited reroll, if
you retire your character for a month before level 26 and for a year
from level 26 and up, however that is as the name suggest quite limited
in how much it can alter your base abilities.

Example: A mage with 8 WIS works fine in D&D based systems but won't be
good as a mage in MUME; in fact, such a character in MUME would be a
very poor mage.

#### Hints

You will not be given the opportunity to choose your own base
abilities - or stats as most people call them - unless you have a
character in your account that is not marked as a newcomer. When you
choose one of the pre-selected base abilities, that character is marked
as a newcomer until the character reaches level 13 or 14. But you can
also 'change newcomer off' to force it off early. Therefore, if you want
to choose your own base abilities, you either need to reach non-newcomer
status (level 13 or 14), or turn it off. If you are a new or returning
player who lost their account, you may therefore need to create a
character, turn newcomer off, and then create a new character so that
you can choose its base abilities.

A few important things to think about when choosing your stats:

- PER + INT will decide how good track you get. 100% is generally seen
  as good and requires PER+INT to be around 26-27. With PER+INT below 20
  it might not be worth practicing track at all, since you might not be
  able to see any tracks no matter how much time you spend looking for
  them.
- INT and WIS decides how much mana you get, but max mana is generally
  not of critical importance. INT has a slightly larger effect on mana
  than WIS, and the gain is linearly related to the stats.
- WIL affects your manaregen, but age and equipment usually have a much
  larger effect.
- CON has a large effect on your over all hit points, movement points,
  and hit and move regen.
- STR effects how much you can carry, which directly affects your flee
  chances, move point use, and Dodge Bonus DB.

The ranges are based on the character being a human, so for other races
modify the ranges with the race modifiers; or don't and get a less
specialized but likely more all-round character.

### Mage

|                                                                    |           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------:|
| STR: Higher STR will allow you to use heavier armour.              | \[10-13\] |
| INT: Max. You can never have more than enough INT as a mage.       |    \[18\] |
| WIS: Quite high, though max is good it is far from essential.      | \[16-18\] |
| DEX: You want some, but much won't help you much at all.           | \[10-13\] |
| CON: Can help a lot, but not always as much as you might think.    | \[10-14\] |
| WIL: Some. If you want charm/sleep to work well get it quite high. | \[14-17\] |
| PER: Some.                                                         | \[11-14\] |

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------:|
| STR: Higher STR will allow you to use heavier armour.                   | \[10-13\] |
| INT: Max, but if really needed you can drop it a little.                | \[17-18\] |
| WIS: Max.                                                               |    \[18\] |
| DEX: Some is good, but you can get away with very little with high WIL. |  \[8-12\] |
| CON: Can help a lot, but not always as much as you might think.         | \[10-14\] |
| WIL: Very high, Max isn't needed but helpful at least on lower levels.  | \[16-18\] |
| PER: Enough to get as much track as you want.                           |  \[8-11\] |

### Warrior

|                                                                        |           |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------:|
| STR: If you want to be able to use good damage weapons get 18.         | \[17-18\] |
| INT: Enough to together with PER get as much track as you want.        |  \[8-12\] |
| WIS: Not much use, unless you want a lot of leadership.                |     \[8\] |
| DEX: You really want some, and possibly very high.                     | \[13-18\] |
| CON: The most important stat for most warriors.                        | \[17-18\] |
| WIL: The more the better, but you can't get everything and some is ok. | \[13-17\] |
| PER: Enough to get as much track as you want.                          |  \[8-14\] |

### Scout

|                                                                                     |           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------:|
| STR: Will help you carry more and increase damage, so get some and more if you can. | \[14-16\] |
| INT: Not much use, but can put leftover points in it.                               |  \[8-10\] |
| WIS: Very little use, so don't waste points on it.                                  |     \[8\] |
| DEX: Primary stat for scouts, so get max.                                           |    \[18\] |
| CON: Will decide how mobile you are, so get as much as you can.                     | \[15-18\] |
| WIL: Helps some, but can mostly be compensated for so most keep it low.             | \[10-14\] |
| PER: Important to get scout skills high. Pure scouts work with less.                | \[16-18\] |

One last thing to think about is that a character that someone finds
good and/or fun to play might not be that for someone else.
