(S."Hithaeglir") The range of mountains running from Carn Dum in the
north to Methadras (above Angrenost) in the south. The Misty Mountains
form a formiddable barrier between Eriador and the lands of Rhovanian.
Only a few passes cross the Hithaeglir and foul weather renders even
these paths unpassable for many months of the year.
