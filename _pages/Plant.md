*This article is about a type of mobile. For other plants, see
[herb](herb "wikilink").*

**Plants** are a type of [mobile](mobile "wikilink") that includes
[Ents](Ent "wikilink") and other animated trees, vines, fungi etc.
Plants are vulnerable to fire, so [spells](spell "wikilink") like
[Burning Hands](Burning_Hands "wikilink") or
[Fireball](Fireball "wikilink") deal extra damage to them. Most plants
have no eyes and thus are not affected by the
[Blindness](Blindness "wikilink") spell.
