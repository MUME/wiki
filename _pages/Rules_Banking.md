**Banking** is storing items and [gold](gold "wikilink") so that you may
have a source of new [equipment](equipment "wikilink") should you for
some reason lose your old equipment. Bank characters usually have lots
of gold and have tons of good equipment. When discovered, bank
characters lose all equipment; both bank and "client" can be subjected
to harsher punishments as well - for instance, loss of
[levels](level "wikilink").

Another obvious form of banking is to [hide](hide "wikilink") or hand
off your equipment for safekeeping whilst you deliberately
[DT](death_trap "wikilink"). Similarly, hiding equipment before you get
[pkilled](player_killing "wikilink") is only allowed if you don't
recover it (or tell anyone else about it). Clearly, this also applies to
leaving your equipment or gold in the safe- keeping of another character
whilst you go off into a risky situation. The same applies to obvious
variations with the same intention: giving equipment to
[mobs](mob "wikilink"), hiding it in [rooms](room "wikilink"), etc.

A slightly less obvious form of banking, is making multiple [legend
home](Legend_Homes "wikilink") payments without spending any of the
money on upgrades. In the helpfiles on legend homes, it is specified
that players may make a maximum of 2 payments (one down payment and
another payment of the balance), after which they must spend that money
before being allowed to make another payment. There may be certain cases
in which a third payment is justified, however those cases must be
explicitly approved by the legend home supervisor, and that third
payment would most certainly be the final one. Four or more unspent
payments on a legend home are very clearly banking.

It is also forbidden to exchange equipment between characters which
belong to the same player. If you own characters A and B, you cannot
transfer equipment or money between them, neither directly (which
involves multiplaying) nor indirectly (for instance, A gives C an [iron
ring](iron_ring "wikilink"), [rents](rent "wikilink"), logs in B and
gets the ring back; or, A hides the ring, rents, logs in B and
[reveals](reveal "wikilink") it).

The only exception to what is said above is if character A gets killed
by another player's [orc](orc "wikilink"), and - later - character B
kills that orc (or vice versa). Obvious suiciding by char A and the orc
is of course not allowed.

The minimum punishment for equipment exchange is destruction of the
exchanged equipment, though usually the punishment is much harsher.
