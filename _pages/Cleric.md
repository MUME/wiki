The **cleric** is the more supportive [spell](spell "wikilink") caster.
The spells of [wisdom](wisdom "wikilink") offer peace, blessing and
healing as well as protection. While clerics are defensively oriented
spell casters, they do have several spells that can inflict great pain
upon their enemies.

### Opinion

Clerics are the best support class. They are necessary for nearly all
[end game content](smob "wikilink") with their ability to [reduce
damage](sanctuary "wikilink") to allies and
[blind](blindness "wikilink") foes!
