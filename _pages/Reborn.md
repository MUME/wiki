[Trolls](Troll "wikilink") who [sundie](sundeath "wikilink") can use the
'<b>reborn</b>' command to have their [trophy](trophy "wikilink")
cleared (thereby losing the list of pkills of their previous life) or
not.

The 'reborn' command can only be used if you are a newly sundead troll,
without any [experience](experience "wikilink") or [travel
points](travel_point "wikilink").

If you died to what looks like a [bug](bug "wikilink"), don't use the
'reborn' command, or the [Valar](Ainur "wikilink") won't be able to
reimburse you.
