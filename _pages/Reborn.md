title: "Reborn"
---

Trolls who sundie can choose whether to have their
[trophy](trophy "wikilink") cleared (thereby losing the list of pkills
of their previous life) or not.

If you are a newly sundead troll, without any
[experience](experience "wikilink") or [travel
points](travel_points "wikilink"), you can use the REBORN command to
obtain a trophy reset.

If you died to what looks like a [bug](bug "wikilink"), don't use the
REBORN command, or the Valar won't be able to reimburse you.
