Ents, Shepherds of the Trees, created at the prayer of Yavanna the Vala
to protect the forests of Middle-Earth, are certainly very ancient,
possibly even predating the Elves. They are a race of giant, tree-like
people whose purpose was to protect the forests of Middle-earth. By the
end of the Third Age, the great forests had dwindled, and so had the
Ents, but they were still to be found in [Fangorn](Fangorn "wikilink")
Forest.
