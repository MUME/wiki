**Ents**, Shepherds of the Trees, created at the prayer of Yavanna the
Vala, are certainly very ancient, possibly even predating the
[Elves](elf "wikilink"). They are a race of giant, tree-like people
whose purpose was to protect the forests of
[Middle-earth](Middle-earth "wikilink"). By the end of the Third Age,
the great forests had dwindled, and so had the Ents, but they were still
to be found in [Fangorn](Fangorn "wikilink") Forest.

In [MUME](MUME "wikilink"), Ents are [plant](plant "wikilink")-type
[mobiles](mobile "wikilink"). Just like in the books, they are found
within Fangorn. While not normally aggressive towards white-side
players, they will be angered if you attack them, or if they see you
[casting](cast "wikilink") fire or lightning [spells](spell "wikilink").
In that case, you will be given several warnings to leave the forest,
and if you fail to do so, all Ents in Fangorn will become hostile to
you.

This is something you probably want to avoid, as Ents are tough
opponents to face. They are at least [level](level "wikilink") 18, very
hard to kill through their tough bark, they can [bash](bash "wikilink")
and some of them [track](track "wikilink"), and they
[damage](state "wikilink") your [weapon](weapon "wikilink") and
[shield](shield "wikilink") if you [parry](parry "wikilink") any of
their attacks.
