Calenardhon (S."Horse-land") after T.A.2510. Called The Mark or
Riddermark, it is a fertile, grassy region granted to the Rohirrim (a
semi-nomadic Northman race) in return for their aid against the Balchoth
and their oath of loyalty to the Kings and Stewards of Gondor. Rohan's
chief town is Edoras.
