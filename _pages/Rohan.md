## In the books

Calenardhon (S."Horse-land") after T.A.2510. Called The Mark or
Riddermark, it is a fertile, grassy region granted to the
[Rohirrim](Rohirrim "wikilink") (a semi-nomadic Northman race) in return
for their aid against the Balchoth and their oath of loyalty to the
Kings and Stewards of Gondor. Rohan's chief town is Edoras.

## MUME zones

Only the northwest of Rohan exists in the today's MUME, but work is in
progress for the addition of further zones.

The primary location with Rohir mobs is the fortification on the Eyot in
the Isen providing a crossing point over the Isen between
[Dunland](Dunland "wikilink") and [Fangorn](Fangorn "wikilink"). The
fortification provides a rent spot and stables. It's not possible to
obtain the citizenship of Rohan at the moment, however travellers from
all western races are welcome. Weapons can be worn openly, but casting
is an offense punished with jail time except for the rent room.
