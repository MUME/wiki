The Guild is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles and
perils of a cruel world. There they may participate in discussions about
the skills and strengths of their class, as well as perhaps offering
advice to those new to these lands. Guilds are also the places where you
should go to learn and practice the skills of your trade.

The quality of each guild directly depends of the master keeping it.
This is why you can't expect every guild master to have full knowledge
of any particular art. You might find that you need to seek a more
skilled master to reach a complete understanding of some skill or spell.

If you wish to know the use of a particular skill or spell, you can ask
any guild master who teaches this ability for information:
