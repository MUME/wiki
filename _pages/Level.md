With every new level, [practice](practice "wikilink") points become
available, that can be used in [guilds](Guild "wikilink") to learn new
skills.

The command [Level](Level "wikilink") lists the experience and travel
points required for your current level and for a few higher levels.

Example: Level 1 1 exp, 0 tp Level 2 1000 exp, 100 tp Level 3 3000 exp,
300 tp Level 4 7000 exp, 600 tp Level 5 14500 exp, 1000 tp
