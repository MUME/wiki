title: Istari
---

## Background

When the power of Sauron began to grow again in the Third Age, five
great Wizards arrived to combat the evil. Only three were ever known,
Saruman the White - the most powerful, and head of the Istari; Gandalf
the Grey, the wisest; and Radagast the Brown, the most at home with
Nature. Of the other two, Alatar and Pallando, very little has ever been
spoken.

## MUME Istari

Within MUME, there are theoretically an unlimited number of Istari, as
the Istar Quest is the route a player must take to reach
[immortality](Ainur "wikilink") - as such, the istar is considered a
"proto-Ainur". The Istari levels are 23 to 25, with a good aligned level
25 Istar being the Head of the Istari Council, the Tan Istar. It is the
purpose of the Istari in the game to help low level players.

Istari should be there not only to help gain experience, but to advise
new players of simple rules, and to teach them the basics of gameplay.

## The Istar Quest

Any player at level 21 or higher, and with a sufficiently high
[alignment](alignment "wikilink"), may opt to take the Istar Quest by
sailing west to Valinor, and visiting the Istari Sanctuary, where they
may listen to the Ainulindalë. If they are successful, they will be
returned to level 21 and must spend the next two levels of their quest
in the Meta levels (see [Metamorph](Metamorph "wikilink")). Starting at
level 23, they can progress as an Istar in humanoid form, whose primary
task is to assist new players, or continue as a metamorph. At level 26
or higher, a player may ascend to immortality by again sailing west to
Valinor and listening to the Ainulindalë once again.

Once a player undertakes the quest he has no more than 15 MUME years (90
real life days) in which to complete it. A player on the Istar Quest has
certain advantages over normal characters - for example, they need no
longer consume food or water, and their spells become less expensive.
They also gain the ability to change into animal form (see
[Metamorph](Metamorph "wikilink")). As such, and since he is in effect
an apprentice immortal, during the quest, the player is bound by far
stricter rules than normal characters.

### Rules

A player on the istar quest is expected to abide by the strictest
standards as regards defence of all that is good.

Istari are expected not to cheat, and to promptly report bugs which
could be abused. People on the Istari Quest must not commit evil acts:
the slaying of a hobbit child will affect a Metamorph, Elda or Istar far
more than it would affect a normal mortal. Nor should an Istar deal in
evil items of power, such as mottled cloaks or morgul blades: an Istar
should destroy similar items, not use them or encourage their use.

Same-side player killing is strictly forbidden, unless the victim is
listed on [Saurons List](Saurons_List "wikilink").

Since their main task is to help and protect newbies, Istari, Eldar and
metamorphs may not engage actively in the race war, except to defend the
strongholds of the west if they are under invasion. Defending Fornost or
Bree from an onslaught of Orcs is fine, also encouraged, since it
defends the young people of the West. Traveling east with legends to
hunt them down in their lairs is not. The job of the Istar is not to
seek his/her own personal fame or profit, but to be a source of help and
knowledge for the inexperienced. Unless a young character wants your
protection on a journey to Rivendell, there should be little reason to
be found in the eastern regions.

Murdering an Istar or the Istar's pupils will cause the murderer to be
put on Sauron's List. On the other hand, Istari who follow Saruman's
path to evil will probably share his fate.

In the past the Valar have let some transgressions of our fledging
ainur, known as istar, go without reprimand or serious penalty. This
will not be the case any longer. Be aware that failure to adequately
complete all conditions of the quest will have serious ramifications.
The gift of Eru will be lost. This applies at all levels of the quest,
metamorph and istar.

### Steps to initiate the Quest

1.  Ask Cirdan to 'sail west'
2.  When Ciryariel talks to you, mention 'istari'
3.  In Valinor, find the room 'Calacirian' and type 'listen ainulindale'

### During the Quest

- During level 21/22 you gain experience and travel points only in meta
  form
- During level 23/24/25 you can still do as above. In addition you can
  also gain XP/TP in normal form, but only indirectly as a percentage of
  XP/TP gained by low level player who are members of your group.
- To see the options that you can meta into, just type the 'meta'
  command. To return into your normal form, use the 'return' command.
- The XP/TP that you are gaining in meta is accumulated and only
  'delivered' to your character once you return.
- You can only gain XP in good or neutral zones.

### Completing the Quest

- Once you reach level 26, sail to Valinor and visit the Calacirian
  again.

### Miscellaneous Information

<spoiler>

- The meta form can use none of your class specific skills. XP will be
  gained by simply hitting mobs.
- You cannot swim or climb in meta form. You can, however, enter open
  water if you are carrying a boat.
- Any equipment you are carrying in normal form, will not be available
  any longer in meta form, until you return
- Any equipment you pick up in meta form will be dropped (even coins)
  when you return. You can then pick it up.
- You cannot communicate while in meta, i.e. you will not see narrates,
  nor can you send or receive tells.
- Many other commands (like 'info') will not work.
- Your meta form does not benefit from spells like armor, bless, or
  shield. However, spell effects will continue to tick down in the
  background, and if they did not yet expire when you return to normal
  form, they will be active again.
- Specific meta forms always have identical stats regardless what stats
  you chose for your character.
- Conversion between meta and normal form may fail. It seems to be most
  successful when at maximum movement points.
- When converting between meta and normal form, your amount of HP/MP
  changes and the current points are rescaled so that the percentage of
  maximum before and after the conversion stays the same.
- When you initiate the quest you are receiving an Istari wand which is
  an improved version of a focused staff.
- If you lose the wand (for example because it is looted in pk), you
  cannot receive a new one. You also cannot create a different focus, so
  if you want to still have a staff, it must be an unfocused one.
- Clerics are an excellent choice for the Istar quest, because
  heal/bob/blind can be very useful.
