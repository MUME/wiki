title: "Hovels"

For the moment, no new Orc Hovels will be installed. There is an ongoing
discussion among the management about the future of Orc Hovels. If you
have any suggestions, feel free to mume mail the Arata of Zones. See
HELP AINU LEVELS for information on who that currently is.

No amount of begging of spamming will change this fact. This is the
current situation, and the only thing that will make it change is the
Valar deciding on one of many ideas for Orkish Hovels.
