It is unacceptable to use a "throw-away" character to scout out the
enemy in situations such as raids. This extends to checking out how many
trolls are in the Warrens, doing a reconnaissance during a Bree raid,
checking how many orcs are on the GER, or anything else you might care
to imagine, with regard to the war. Further, this rule does not apply
solely to newbies - it applies to any obvious "throw-away" character. If
in any doubt whether this applies to your case - don't do it.
