This command can be used to mark a message on a bulletin board that you
wish to remember.

Usage: mark <number>

Messages marked like this are still displayed by 'look board' even if
they have been read (they are marked with a '\*' after the message
number). You can use 'unmark <number>' to remove the mark. 'mark last'
and 'unmark last' can also be used.
