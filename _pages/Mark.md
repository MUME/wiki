This command can be used to **mark** a message on a bulletin
[board](board "wikilink") that you wish to remember.

Usage: mark <number>

Messages marked like this are still displayed by
'[look](look "wikilink") board' even if they have been
[read](read "wikilink") (they are marked with a '\*' after the message
number). You can use 'unmark <number>' to remove the mark. 'mark last'
and 'unmark last' can also be used.
