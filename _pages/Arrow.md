\> **look arrow**

The roughly three feet long shaft of this arrow is quite thin and
straight. It

is made of pine and has a fletching of grey goose feathers at one end
while on

the other one a sharp head of metal is attached.

\> **consider arrow**

Its accuracy is awful, and it inflicts very little damage upon hitting.

It weighs a couple of ounces.
