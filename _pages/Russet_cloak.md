## Statistics

!# CW\>**examine cloak**
The cloak is made from a finely-woven fabric of a deep reddish-brown
colour.
Thin strands of darker browns, and minute flecks of silver-grey lend to
the
fabric a richer look, which complements the superior workmanship and
subtle
styling of the garment.

!# CW\>**consider cloak**
It is a russet cloak (satisfactory, fresh).
It weighs a couple of pounds.
It fits you well.

## Opinions

The cloak is identical to [a forest green
cloak](a_forest_green_cloak "wikilink") (FGC) in all important aspects
(most obviously the +5db), but is a less commonly seen item because it
is rather more difficult to obtain than an FGC for low level
characters.
