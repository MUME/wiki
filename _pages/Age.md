**Age** affects a character's [statistics](statistic "wikilink")
according to the following table. The change is linear between the
various age brackets; so, the modifier for strength changes from -1 to 0
at age 21 (midpoint of 18 and 24), and from 0 to +1 at age 28 (midpoint
of 24 and 32).

Age: 18 24 32 40 50 65 90 Statistics: STR 0 1 1 0 -1 -1 -2 INT 1 1 1 0 0
0 -1 WIS -1 0 0 1 1 2 2 DEX 1 1 0 0 -1 -2 -3 CON 0 1 1 0 0 -1 -2 WIL 1 1

Your initial age depends on your base statistics: characters more suited
to the life of a [warrior](warrior "wikilink") start out younger; those
more suited to spellcasting begin adventuring at an older age.

Aging rate depends on [races](race "wikilink") (see 'help races' for
more information). Ages shown in the previous table refer to Men
(excluding Dúnedain); for other races the following table applies.

Multiplier \| 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th \| Race
-----------+-----------------------------+------------------------------------
1.0 \| 18 24 32 40 50 65 90 \| Man (Other), Bear 1.5 \| 27 36 48 60 75
97 135 \| Man (Dúnadan, Númenorean), Hobbit 2.0 \| 36 48 64 80 100 130
180 \| Half-Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Troll 2.5 \| 45 60 80 100 125 162 225 \|
Elf (Silvan) 3.0 \| 54 72 96 120 150 195 270 \| Elf (Sinda) 3.5 \| 63 84
112 140 175 227 315 \| Elf (Noldo)

Age is how slow members of this race age compared to Men. I.e., an Elf
ages 3 times slower, and a Hobbit 1.5 times slower.
