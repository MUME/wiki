title: "Butcher"
---

Travelling in the wilderness can sometimes result in the poor explorer
running out of food. The solution to this problem just might be the
"butcher" command. If you have killed an animal that you think should be
able to give you some food, hides or whatever, type "butcher corpse",
and you will soon find out if you were able to produce anything useful.

To easier pick the right corpse, you can also "butcher pig-corpse" or
similar.

Of course, you need to wield some kind of tool to be able to exploit the
dead corpse in front of you...

To aid playability, it is actually enough to wear a scalping tool (on a
belt for example).

A [corpse](corpse "wikilink") which has already been butchered (or
scalped) is readily identifiable.

Orcs and Trolls are not famous for their regard for the dead, so they
can use the butcher command to produce "food" from the corpses of dead
players...
