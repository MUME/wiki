Travelling in the wilderness can sometimes result in the poor explorer
running out of food. The solution to this problem just might be the
"**butcher**" command. If you have killed an animal that you think
should be able to give you some [food](food "wikilink"), hides or
whatever, type "butcher [corpse](corpse "wikilink")", and you will soon
find out if you were able to produce anything useful.

To easier pick the right corpse, you can also "butcher pig-corpse" or
similar.

Of course, you need to [wield](wield "wikilink") some kind of tool to be
able to exploit the dead corpse in front of you.

To aid playability, it is actually enough to [wear](wear "wikilink") a
scalping tool (on a [belt](belt "wikilink") for example).

A corpse which has already been butchered (or
[scalped](scalp "wikilink")) is readily identifiable.

Orcs and Trolls are not famous for their regard for the dead, so they
can use the butcher command to produce "food" from the corpses of dead
players.
