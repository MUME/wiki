title: "Zaugurz Orc"
---

The Uruk-Zaugurz is a tribe on the rise from far north in the Misty
Mountains. Hardened by cold from their home in the freezing caves of
northern Misty's, the Zaugurz have come to wage war and claim loot for
the tribes expanding territory. The Zaugurz hoards stops for nothing and
wages war upon everything living. Not long ago The Uruk-Zaugurz and the
Uruk-Tarkhnarb tribes were allies, but after a sneak attack on Goblin
Gate one night, resulting in chaos, mayhem and rivers and blood, the
allience . When the Tarkhnarbs finally regained controll over their
caves, the Great Goblins ten best breeding females all had been
captured, not to mention all the treasures now collecting dust up north
instead. After this incident the Tarkhnarb and all their allies are
sworn enemies of the Uruk-Zaugurz and vice versa. Since the Zaugurz have
rejected all allies no wargs can be used as mounts, a treat other orcs
can enjoy, whilst the Zaugurz soldier is forced to run on his feet.

After the treacherous ambush on Goblin Gate the Zaugurz built a small
outpost some North West of the Tarkhnarbs home cave. The Outpost have no
real defence worth mentioning, yet the hostile climate surrounding it
and the iron will of the Zaugurz forces have kept it well protected from
enemies.

The Zaugurz outpost does not only offers poor protection, there is also
no stores, only a blacksmith sent from up north to mend basic kind of
weapons and armour for the cause. On the positive side the rent cost for
the Zaugurz is close to free. Furthermore there are only two paths of
profession available for the Zaugurz orc, the insidious and agile way of
the scout and the pure brute force of the Warrior. There is also a
possibility to train ranger skills in the Zaugurz caves, but there is no
possibility to master magic as Zaugurz. No Master of Black Magic seems
willing to teach the Zaugurz tribe magic, rendering the usage of Mana
obsolete, thus Zaugurz have no Mana points.
