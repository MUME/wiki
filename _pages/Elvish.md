There are 2 Elvish tongues generally used in the *[The Lord of the
Rings](wikipedia:en:The_Lord_of_the_Rings "wikilink")*: "the High-elven
or [Quenya](wikipedia:en:Quenya "wikilink"), and the Grey-elven, or
[Sindarin](wikipedia:en:Sindarin "wikilink"). The High-elven was an
ancient tongue of [Eldamar](wikipedia:en:Eldamar "wikilink") beyond the
Sea, the first to be recorded in writing. It was no longer a
birth-tongue, but had become, as it were, an 'Elven-Latin', still used
for ceremony, and for high matters of lore and song".

"The Grey-elven was in origin akin to Quenya; for it was the language of
those Eldar who, coming to the shores of
[Middle-Earth](Middle-Earth "wikilink"), had not passed over the Sea but
had lingered on the coasts in the country of Beleriand." Eventually,
"their tongue had become far estranged from the speech of the Eldar from
beyond the Sea." In general, the Elves in Middle-Earth "had adopted
Sindarin for daily use; and hence it was the tongue for all those Elves
and Elf-Lords".

King](wikipedia:en:The_Return_of_the_King "wikilink")*.
