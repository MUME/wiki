If you are trying to swim on a body of water, and you become too tired
to keep afloat, you will gulp water and eventually drown.

The risk of drowning in rivers, ponds and lakes is usually quite small
for those who have learned at least the bases of swimming. On the
contrary, the brave ones who dive into underwater caverns, or in the
depths of a lake, might find themselves dead if they are not excellent
swimmers, or if they tarry too long.
