If you are trying to [swim](swim "wikilink") on a [body of
water](waterways "wikilink"), and you become too
[tired](movement_points "wikilink") to keep afloat, you will gulp water
and eventually **drown**.

The risk of drowning in rivers, ponds and lakes is usually quite small
for those who have [learned](practice "wikilink") at least the bases of
swimming. On the contrary, the brave ones who dive into underwater
caverns, or in the depths of a lake, might find themselves
[dead](death "wikilink") if they are not excellent swimmers, or if they
tarry too long.
