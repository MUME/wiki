Newbie Guide Herblores

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

"Thereupon the herb-master entered. 'Your lordship asked for kingsfoil,
as the rustics name it,' he said; 'or athelas in the noble tongue, or to
those who know somewhat of the Valinorean...' 'I do so,' said Aragorn,
'and I care not whether you say now asÃ«a aranion or kingsfoil, so long
as you have some.'"

JRRT, The Return of the King

This guide is using and making herblores in MUME. I will not be going
into very much on specific herblores, but more of the general idea of
how to make them.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at: <https://mume.org/help/help_index>

Bold words can be looked up in the games help files. Like help mix.
