title: "Fletched arrow"
---

The base of this arrow contains feathered fletching. A silvery arrowhead
adorns the top of it and assuredly adds to the deadliness if the arrow
is used in combat. The shaft feels silk smooth to the hand and seems to
be of an incredibly old yet still sturdy wood. This is truly the product
of a meticulous and skilled craftsman.

It is a fletched arrow. Its accuracy is awful, and it inflicts little
damage upon hitting. It weighs a few ounces.
