title: Fletched arrow
---

\> **look arrow**

The base of this arrow contains feathered fletching. A silvery arrowhead
adorns

the top of it and assuredly adds to the deadliness if the arrow is used
in

combat. The shaft feels silk smooth to the hand and seems to be of an

incredibly old yet still sturdy wood. This is truly the product of a
meticulous

and skilled craftsman.

\> **consider arrow**

Its accuracy is awful, and it inflicts little damage upon hitting.

It weighs a few ounces.
