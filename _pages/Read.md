title: "Read"

Obviously, this is used for reading things.

To read a message on a bulletin board, you have to read its number (e.g.
to read message 25, "read 25"). If you try to read a message but you
can't see its contents, try to "catchup" (see "help board").

To read the contents of a book or of a note, you might have to hold it
in your hands.
