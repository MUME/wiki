With the right equipment and some time on one's hands, one can fish the
rivers and lakes of Arda. To do so you must have either a sturdy fishing
pole or a fishing net woven of strong thread.

With a pole, you will simply need to hold it and type FISH. If you
prefer using a net, you will need to hold it and type USE NET. Once you
have cast your net into the water, you should let it sit a little while
and then pull it in quickly! With any luck, some curious rudd or a stray
grayling may have wandered into it's grasp and onto your supper plate.

Example: \> fish \> use net, get net See also: [Milk](Milk "wikilink"),
