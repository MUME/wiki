title: Herblore
tags: ["Guides"]
---
A **herblore** is a recipe that will provide you with a potion or other
item to help you in your travels. They can be learnt by helping certain
[mobiles](mobile "wikilink") or by reading an ancient scroll or book. To
make them, you must have the [items](Herb "wikilink") specified in the
herblore instructions, a herbal kit and you must have acquired the lore.

Not all herblores can be learnt by every character. Those who have
aligned themselves with [Sauron](Sauron "wikilink") will certainly not
be able to gain any herblores taught by [Elves](Elf "wikilink").

[Herbal kits](Herbal_kit "wikilink") can be improved by various
herbalists and by some other skilled people.

# Poisons

In order to poison an opponent you need the poison vial and the
[envenom](envenom "wikilink") skill.

## Arachnia

### Effects

The poison saps one's energy, reducing [mana](mana "wikilink") and
[movement points](movement_points "wikilink"). As the poison progresses,
it first forces the afflicted creature to sit down and
[rest](rest "wikilink") periodically, then fall
[asleep](sleep "wikilink"), and finally to fall into a deep slumber as
if affected by the [Sleep](Sleep_Spell "wikilink") spell.

### Recipe

Among the beasts of our lands, the spiders are the most feared, mostly
because they sting their victim and inject a poison which slows their
moves and their brain. Thanks to a careful study of the grey spider
anatomy, we have been able to use the venom sack of this beast to
produce a terribly dangerous poison. In a bowl, crush the tail of a
young salamander into a shapeless pulp. Add the fur of a bat to
stabilize the components, and, most important, the fluid sack of a grey
spider. The sack must have been butchered recently from the monster, and
kept in a wet sack during its transport. Mix the three ingredients until
a brownish liquid is obtained.

**Ingredients:** salamander tail, bat fur, and grey fluid-sack

## Belladonna

The plants of the wilderness have a large spectrum of applications.
Those who know the use of three natural ingredients can produce a mild
poison. Crush carefully the tongue of a frog in a vial, as base for your
concoction. Get a freshly recolted Belladonna, the plant known for its
dangerous properties. Use the fruits or the leaves of the plant, for it
is where its essence is mostly concentrated. Add then a red mushroom,
the sort which gives headache and dizziness when eaten. Mix the reagents
and seal the liquid in a vial. That draught will weaken your opponent,
who will lose an important part of his skills. It can of course be used
to poison your arrows or your blade.

**Ingredients:** a long, sticky bit of flesh, [some violet
berries](Herb#Belladonna "wikilink"), and [a red
mushroom](Herb#Red_mushroom_.2F_Agaric_mushroom "wikilink")

## Drake-slumber

This is the recipe of a brew which should be able to debilitate even a
very powerful beast - one which would not succumb to ordinary magic or
weaker potions and poisons.

The sticky pulp of a fresh milkweed plant will make a ready base for the
draught. All parts of thisplant cause weakness and staggering, then
prostration, laboured breathing and a profound sleep. This should serve
to slow and weaken the creature, despite its strength and size. To the
base add some valerian root and the flowers of the mountain poppy -
these herbs act to tranquilise and to alter the workings of the mind.
They also inhibit aggression, which will be most important in
controlling the beast.

Leaves, flowers and fruit of the hemlock plant will weaken the animal,
slowing its heart and suppressing its breathing. A single fly agaric
mushroom is also needed - the flesh of this bright red fungus is said to
bring on dizziness and a lack of coordination, followed by a deep sleep.

To complete the brew one white fruit of the baneberry plant is needed.
This strong poison will weaken the creature, and should further assist
in bringing about dizziness and poor flow of the blood.

**Ingredients:** milkweed mass, a foul-smelling root, poppy, hemlock
plant, red mushroom, baneberries

## Hemlock

The plants of the wilderness have a large spectrum of applications.
Those who know the use of the herbs can produce a whole set of curing
concoctions, and of deadly mixtures also. This is the formula for one of
the worst. Carefully crush the tongue of an old frog as base of your
preparation. Take the leaves, the stem and the fruits of a hemlock and
add them. Add then a handful of inkberries from Hollin. Mix carefully
and seal it in a vial. That draught will weaken all the abilities of the
person drinking it, and can successfully be poured over your blade to
poison your opponents.

**Ingredients:** tongue of a frog, hemlock plant and inkberries.

## Psylonia

### Effects

Drains [mana](mana "wikilink") very quickly. Can be somewhat hard to
deal with, as even if you have [Remove Poison](Remove_Poison "wikilink")
your mana may get drained too low to be able to [cast](cast "wikilink")
it.

### Recipe

Anyone who ate the wrong mushroom knows that the effects of mushroom
intoxication can be really surprising. Headache, dizziness,
hallucinations are some of the possible symptoms. Some people, like the
inhabitants of the remote land known as Yuka Taan, south of Harad, use
mushrooms as a drug. Others have found a more warlike usage. The orcs of
the east know many preparations based on mushrooms. One of the most
efficient, a poison which does not kill the victims, but drains them and
stop their concentration, is described here. The base is made by a
handful of inkberries from Hollin. A red mushroom is crushed with the
berries, to thicken the paste. The third ingredient is the most
important: the rare, sickly green, mushroom. It must be added before the
concoction is mixed. Few people have ever found this mushroom: it is
rumoured to grow in humid caves or in the darkest forests of the land.

**Ingredients:** inkberries, red mushroom and sickly green mushroom.

## Venom

Extremly lethal poisons can be prepared with natural ingredients found
in the wilderness. The following recipe uses the venom sack of the
feared rattlesnake. Make a base with the tail of an adult salamander.
Add a freshly butchered bat fur, to thicken the paste, and the small
venom sack of a rattlesnake. The resulting liquid will kill a cow in a
few minutes, and even the strongest fighter will risk death in a few
hours.

**Ingredients:** salamander tail, bat fur and small fluid-sack (from a
rattlesnake).

# Potions

## Antidote

Poison is often deadly, and requires immediate action. Nature has
provided us with certain herbs to defend ourselves from this vicious
danger, if we know how to use them. Unfortunately, any remedy we hope to
make will be very complex. The simplest, and most effective, is outlined
below.

First, a base is made with two handfuls of blackberries, because of
their healthy juice. Water lily petals,to purify the blood, and figwort,
to purge the stomach, make that a thick paste. Finally the healing
properties of the kingsfoil make it really efficient.

This mixture will not only cure most of the poisons that can be find in
plants and water, but as well purge your body from the somewhat annoying
effects of any potions.

**Ingredients:** 2 x blackberries, water-lily petals, figwort and
athelas.

## Clear Thoughts

To create this wizard's brew, you must obtain juniper berries for
promotion of higher thought. Mix these with the mystical mauve petals,
to boost creativity, and sage to clear the mind. Finally, some thyme is
needed to aid the memory. This brew will give the mage more energy, and
replenish his energy at a faster rate. However, when the beneficial
effects expire, he will be mentally exhausted.

**Ingredients:** juniper berries, mauve petals, sage leaves and thyme
leaves.

## Healing

The philtre made from this recipe will greatly aid the healing of one
who is wounded, mending bones and staunching blood flow. With this, even
one close to death can become functional over time.Begin the concoction
by mixing two parts of sage. The sage helps against infection, and forms
a base for the other herbs. Add crushed foxtail petals to help close the
wounds. Mix in fresh blackcurrant berries; these also protect against
infection. Finally, leaves from the kingsfoil plant must be added, so
that their healing properties may staunch the blood flow and stimulate
the healing.

**Ingredients:** 2 x sage, foxtail, blackcurrant and athelas

## Orc-balm

To make this, you have to first put in a salamander tail and a bit of
bat fur for consistency. Then mix in some cardamom powder, some
swamp-lily petals, and a little bit of sage. Mix this all up, and the
result should be a viscous brew.

This brew makes the drinker heal quicker for a while, but it burns and
so the snaga can't concentrate well enough to regain much mental energy.
After that wears off, the orc still heals, but not as fast, and his
muscles are slightly tired, making his rest uneasy.

**Ingredients:** salamander tail, bat fur, cardamom powder, water-lily
petals, sage leaves

## Orkish Draught

Any snaga who wants to raid the western plains and rid them of pansy
elves will need some extra stamina from time to time. The draught
described below is really what you need in these cases.

Begin by getting some blood. Elf blood gives the mixture a better
flavour, but if that's not available the blood of any creature will do.
Just make sure someone mixes in it some preserving herb, or your brew
will quickly spoil.

Dissolve in it the preserved blood the tail of a salamander and some bat
fur, to give strength to your paces, and some tarragon leaves - they are
narrow and smell of licorice. Shake well and gulp it down when needed.

**Ingredients:** tarragon leaves, salamander tail, bat fur, vial of
preserved blood.

## Seeing

In the wild strange plants with strange properties can be found. One of
the strangest is the phosphorescent moss which covers the walls of a few
humid caves. It is believed that this light is emitted by a fungus which
lives in symbiosis with the moss. What matters is the possibility to use
it to prepare a draught which gives a limited vision in the night. The
base of this concoction is the brown powder of a cinnamon stalk. In it
add a handfull of rosemary leaves, to make mind more attentive. In this
dry mixture put shreds of humidified phosphorescent moss, and mix
carefully the whole, until you get a phosphorescent liquid. When
quaffing it, you will feel more able to perceive your environment,
specially during in the darkness, thanks to the moss. A side effect of
its activity, as it draws its energy from your body, is to weaken you
for a while. The whole lasts for several days.

**Ingredients:** bag of cinnamon, rosemary leaves and phosphorescent
moss.

## Shadows

In parallel to our world is the world of the Shadows, where undead and
lost souls walk. Potent magic can create gates to this world, and Sauron
the Necromancer has servants who live on the edge of the two worlds.
Other undead creatures, such as the skeletons animated by foul magic,
live also on this edge and their bones an be used as key for the Shadows
world. To concentrate the potency of these bones, you need to make a
base with the powder of a cinnamon stalk, mixed with a few rosemary
leaves which make the mind more receptive. Take then the dried rib bone
of a formerly undead corpse, break it in small pieces, and add it in the
crucible. Crush carefully the three ingredients with a mortar of white
marble, until an homogenous powder is obtained. Once slipped in a bottle
of water, you will have a potion which will give you access to the
shadow world for four nights.

**Ingredients:** bag of cinnamon, rosemary leaves and rib-bone.

## Skillful Oil

This oil, when made, will make the drinker limber and energetic, in
combat he or she will be more able than normal. The base for this recipe
is a tincture of oil. Add paprika for stimulation of the muscles, and
rose petals to warm them. A vanilla bean will cause the blood to
circulate more quickly, and two parts of rosemary will quicken the mind
and speed up reactions. The user must be warned; after the exertion, his
muscles will be tired and stiff for several hours.

**Ingredients:** tincture oil, paprika, rose petals, vanilla bean, 2 x
rosemary leaves.

## Soothing Draught

In the art of making a soothing draught, one must first make a base of
honey. Often honey comes in the form of honey-combs, which must first be
broken up into a thick pulp. Into that you must mix sage, for healing of
the wound, and thyme to prevent the infection and partially numb the
pain. Next, add a handful of blackcurrant so that the reagants can act
together, and finally add the petals of a water lily, so that the blood
may be purified and the wound may close. When this draught is swallowed,
for a while the recipient will experience a healing effect, and his
wounds will heal up. The fight against the infection will induce a
spiritual weakness for a short duration.

**Ingredients:** honeycomb, sage leaves, thyme leaves, blackcurrant
berries and water-lily petals.

## Traveling

One who chooses to travel is greatly aided by this brew. It adds
endurance to the muscles, and speed to the legs. For all of the walkable
daylight, the imbiber will be able to travel farther and gain more
benefit from rest. This simple concoction is made by mixing in tarragon
leaves, to give spring to the step, ginseng root, to give energy to the
muscles, and clover, to aid the blood in its travels.

**Ingredients:** tarragon leaves, ginseng root and clover.

## Walking

One who chooses to walk between the towns of Eriador is greatly aided by
this draught. It adds endurance to the muscles and speeds the legs, for
the small cost of some loss in concentration and adress. To prepare this
brew mix a handfull of tonifiant juniper berries with some clover as a
base. Add a few crushed leaves of marjoram and freshly bought cloves, to
clean the blood of its toxines and stop cramps.

**Ingredients:** clover, juniper berries, marjoram leaves and cloves.

# Food

## Baker

To make bannocks light and brown, all that is needed is one pound of
flour, three eggs, and the sweet golden treasure of a freshly crushed
honeycomb.

Mix the flour and the eggs in a large dish. When this has been
transformed into a homogenous mixture, crush the honeycomb and add it to
the paste.

Mix carefully!

If the paste gets too thick, you may have to add a small quantity of
water or milk. Then form the dough into small round balls, and use all
your talents to cook it in a pan. This will give you enough bannocks for
a week.

Serve with a cup of tea, beautiful crimson bread and rich free butter.

**Ingredients:** sack of flour, 3 x egg, honeycomb.

## Leaf-Cake

There are some situations when one needs all the courage and strength he
can muster. In those critical situations, even the most common flu can
turn a fearsome warrior into a dull mass of flaccid muscles. As the most
prompt to ill race, humans have soon learned how to use herbs to cure
the flu, among them thyme and sage were the most renowned. Later, one
particular flower, formerly raised by the Entwives, appeared to have
even greater healing virtues. From this flower, often called coneflower,
a very effective treatment can be made to heal the average flu.

First of all one has to use honey as a base, but also to relieve the
inflamed throat. Thyme and sage leaves should then be added, as their
healing powers will greatly help the patient. The whole coneflower
should then be mixed into the paste to help fight the infection and
strengthen the body. Finally, the large leaves of the coneflower can be
used to wrap the mixture, producing a sort of leaf-cake.

For any shaman of the Durbūk-hai, providing the tribe with draughts and

with a base of bat fur and a tail of the elusive albino salamander, it
is critical that the tail is still moist! Add to this a vial of
preserved blood... Some shamans claim that blood from an elf gives a
stronger draught, but that is probably nothing but talk. The last
ingredient is a black flower, brought to bloom by the mighty shroud of
darkness that blackens our skies from time to time. This draught will
shroud you in shadows and lessen the burning of the cursed yellow eye.
Be careful though, it has a sting and comes with a cost.

##### Heightened-Senses

- - Description:\*\*

Through arduous experimentation, I have refined a potion with an
extraordinary capability to heighten one's senses. Under the effect of
this potion, no detail is too small and no sound too faint.

recover before it can be exposed again.

The potion needs a stable base, Tarragon works best. Chop it as fine as
possible and stir with water. Make sure to use two leaves to ensure a
useful result. Add powdered Cardamom to the mix; it will act as a
stimulant and increase the effect of the brew. And finally, the main
ingredient, a blighted inkcap. Mince it and add to the potion, heat it
slowly just to the brink of boiling. Let it cool before consumption.

Once mixed, the potion will hold for a long time, but not forever. Make
sure to stir or shake it before drinking if it has been still for an
extended period as the ingredients will tend to sink to the bottom of
the flask.

items worth at least 5000 xp; Angmacil aka DCS is worth less so it could
be the only artefact weapon which doesn't work for the herblore. There
is also one evil item that gives more than 5000 xp and is not an

##### Soothing-Draught

- - Description:\*\* In the art of making a soothing draught, one must
    first make a base of honey.

Often honey comes in the form of honey-combs, which must first be broken
up into a thick pulp. Into that you must mix sage, for healing of the
wound, and thyme to prevent the infection and partially numb the pain.
Next, add a handful of blackcurrant so that the reagents can act
together, and finally add the petals of a water lily, so that the blood
may be purified and the wound may close.

When this draught is swallowed, for a while the recipient will
experience a healing effect and his wounds will heal up. The fight
against the infection will induce a spiritual weakness for a short
duration.

##### Strength

- - Description:\*\*

A body can be strengthened temporarily not only through magical means,
but also with the use of alchemy. While alchemy may produce a weaker
effect than magic, it is often longer lasting.

To create this elixir a base of clover is required. Without this, the
other reagents will be useless. To this base, paprika must be added. The
paprika will augment the muscles and ensure good blood flow. However,
the last and most vital part of the elixir is a root of comfrey to
enhance and lengthen its effect.

The effects of the elixir will not mix well with magically enhanced
strength.

##### Travelling

- - Description:\*\*

One who chooses to travel is greatly aided by this brew. It adds
endurance to the muscles and speed to the legs. For almost an entire
week, the imbiber will be able to travel farther and gain more benefit
from rest.

This simple concoction is made by mixing in tarragon leaves, to give
spring to the step, ginseng root, to give energy to the muscles, and
clover, to aid the blood in its travels.

- - How to obtain:\*\*

Visit the Dunadan Ranger at Weathertop, and ask him about "Herblore." If
you have enough TPs (Not sure how many required since TP changes.) and
have the maximum good alignment (You must have been sent to Arda to free
it from the sorrows that weigh upon it.), he will ask you to bring him
several items. You must collect these items by your self, you cannot be
grouped, or have anyone in the zone when you pick up the items or kill
the beast that loads them even. Bring the items back to him and he will
teach you how to make traveling lore. These items may be brought back
each individually or all together. The quest may require you to kill and
butcher or collect: Giant White Bear (loads NW of Redhorn pass
<Khuzur side> or out eastside Redhorn a bit NE of the pass Exit.) Ice
Demon (SW of ZoC) Cavern-Wing (Moria and SW of Khuzur) and collect a
Green mushroom (Slab near BM with spirits and a shadow, under goblin
leader in goblin caves near Fork)

##### Walking

- - Description:\*\* One who chooses to walk between the towns of
    Eriador is greatly aided by this draught. It adds endurance to the
    muscles and speeds the legs, for the small cost of some loss in
    concentration and adress.

To prepare this brew mix a handful of tonifiant juniper berries with
some clover as a base. Add a few crushed leaves of marjoram and freshly
bought cloves, to clean the blood of its toxines and stop cramps.

- - How to obtain:\*\* Complete the
    [quest](mumequests#aldereons_s_quest "wikilink") given by Aldereon

affect you for the mume week, and other brews won't affect you during
this time (including brews of the same type - you can't refresh it when
it gets weaker, just need to wait until it wears off).

##### Hemlock

- - Description:\*\* The plants of the wilderness have a large spectrum
    of applications. Those who know the use of the herbs can produce a
    whole set of curing concoctions and deadly mixtures as well. This is
    the formula for one of the worst.

Carefully crush a frog's tongue as the base of your preparation. Take
the leaves, the stem and the fruits of a hemlock plant and add them.
Then add a handful of inkberries from the region in the south known as
Hollin. Mix all of inkberries(4/10): psylonia, hemlock these ingredients
carefully and seal it in a vial.

Simply smear the poison on a blade and the next victim of the weapon
will succumb to its negative effects.

- - How to obtain:\*\* The corpse of Wuda in Dunland is sometimes found
    with this herblore. Solo-able by all, but definitely easier with a
    group. He yells and calls all hunters and trappers and warriors
    nearby to his call. Makes it hard to solo stab, or hit him. Easier
    to kill all of the surrounding trappers, warriors, hunters, and then
    try to stab/hit him.

<!-- -->

- - Ingredients:\*\* [hemlock](mumeherbslist#hemlock "wikilink"),
    [inkberries](mumeherbslist#inkberries "wikilink"), [frog
    tongue](mumeherbslist#frog_tongue "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- - Product: \*\* a green stinking vial that weighs 4 pounds when full.

<!-- -->

- - Effects:\*\* Once poisoned, the tested victim was affected for 9
    minutes.

The first 3 minutes, the victim's stats were affected by Str -3, Dex -3,
Con -2. It is assumed that the change in these stats accounted for a
loss of -2 OB, and -2 DB. Total hit points seem unaffected. The victim
gets a message, "You feel really bad." and lost -3 hps, -2 mana, and -2
moves every 20 to 30 seconds for a total of 7 times over this first 3
minutes.

The second 3 minutes, the victim's stats were affected by Str -5, Dex
-4, Con -3, and a resulting loss of -13 OB, and -3 DB. The victim gets a
message, "You feel terribly sick." and lost -4 hps, -4 mana, -6 moves
every 20 to 30 seconds for a total 7 times over the second 3 minutes.

During the last 3 minutes, the victim's stats were affected by Str -2,
Dex -2, Con -1, and a loss of -1 OB, and -1 DB. The victim gets a
message, "You feel bad." and lost -2 hps, -3 mana, -3 moves every 20 to
30 seconds for a total 7 times over the last 3 minutes. After this, the
victim was no longer subject to the poison.

- - Remark:\*\* The vial is enough to apply 8 times on a spear before
    being empty.

Note that while the loss of OB is related to the loss of strength, it is
also dependent on the strength requirement of the weapon being wielded.
The required strength for the weapon and character tested was 18. The
strength stat dropped from 20 to 15 for the middle portion of the
poison. The resulting lower ob is a combination of loss of strength, as
well as the character strength not being enough to wield the weapon in
question. If the tested character was wielding a weapon requiring less
strength, for example 12, the ob loss would likely not be as great. All
of this to say the loss of ob and db are dependent on the character
stats and weapon, and likely to be different for different characters.

##### Venom

- - Description:\*\* Some poisons have effects on mental capacities,
    others will induce sleep. Venom

will cause the victim's health and ability to move to decrease as the
poison runs its course.

This extremely lethal poison can be prepared with natural ingredients
found in the wilderness. The following recipe uses the venom sack of the
feared rattlesnake. Make a base with the tail of an adult salamander.
Add a freshly butchered bat fur, to thicken the paste, then add the
small venom sack of a rattlesnake. The resulting liquid will kill a cow
in a few minutes, and even the strongest fighter will risk death in a
few hours, if not treated.

Once the liquid is deposited into a vial it is ready to be applied to
any blade or arrow for use against the enemy.

- - How to obtain:\*\* Orc assassin in wnoc sometimes carries this
    herblore, as well as the brigand near the entrance of Mormaeg, just
    north of windswept area.

<!-- -->

- - Ingredients:\*\* [salamander
    tail](mumeherbslist#salamander_tail "wikilink"), [bat
    fur](mumeherbslist#bat_fur "wikilink"), [small-fluid
    sack](mumeherbslist#small-fluid_sack "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- - Product: \*\* a foetid green vial that weighs 5 pounds when full.

<!-- -->

- - Effects:\*\* Once poisoned, the tested victim was affected for 9
    minutes.

The first 3 minutes, the victim's stats were affected by Wis -2, Dex -2,
Con -1. It is assumed that the change in these stats, specifically Dex
accounted for a loss -1 DB. Total hit points seem unaffected. The victim
gets a message, "The venom enters your body." After this initial
message, the victim received the message, "The venom runs into your
veins" and lose 16 hps every 20 to 30 seconds for a total of 6 times
over this first 3 minutes.

The second 3 minutes, the victim's stats were affected by Wis -3, Dex
-4, Con -2, and the resulting loss of -2 DB. The victim gets a message,
"The venom reaches the vial organs." and lost -24 hps every 20 to 30
seconds for a total 6 times over the second 3 minutes.

During the last 3 minutes, the victim's stats were affected by Wis -1,
Dex -2, Con -1, and the resulting loss of -1 DB. The victim gets a
message, "The venom reaches your vital organs" and lost -12 hps every 20
to 30 seconds for a total 6 times over the last 3 minutes. After this,
the victim was no longer subject to the poison.

- - Remark:\*\* The vial is enough to apply 10 times on a spear before
    being empty.

Note that the loss of DB is most likely related to the loss of the dex
stat.

##### Belladonna

- - Description:\*\* The plants of the wilderness have a large spectrum
    of applications. Those who know the use of three natural ingredients
    can produce a mild poison.

Carefully crush the tongue of a frog as a base for your concoction. Get
a freshly picked Belladonna plant, known for its dangerous properties.
Use the berries or the leaves of the plant, for it is where its essence
is mostly concentrated. Add a red mushroom, the sort which gives
headache and dizziness when eaten. Mix the ingredients and seal the
liquid in a vial.

This draught will weaken your victim, who will lose an important part of
his skills. It can of course be used to poison arrows or blades.

- - How to obtain:\*\* The brigand near the entrance of Mormaeg, just
    north of windswept area sometimes carries this lore, as does a
    brigand that can be found between the Grey Havens and the Shire

<!-- -->

- - Ingredients:\*\* [belladonna](mumeherbslist#belladonna "wikilink"),
    [bright red mushroom](mumeherbslist#bright_red_mushroom "wikilink"),
    [frog tongue](mumeherbslist#frog_tongue "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- - Product: \*\* a dark violet vial that weighs 4 pounds when full.

<!-- -->

- - Effects:\*\* Once poisoned, the tested victim was affected for 12
    minutes.

When poisoned the victim sees the message 'You feel bad' and loses -1 hp
and -1 movement point. During the following 4 minutes the victim gets
the message 'You feel really bad' and lost -3 hps, -2 mana, and -3 moves
a total of 2 times before their stats changed.

The second 4 minutes, the victim's stats were affected by Str -1, Dex
-1, and a resulting loss of -1 OB, and -1 DB. The victim gets a message,
"You feel terribly sick." and lost -4 hps, -4 mana, -6 moves a total 2
times over the second 4 minutes.

During the last 4 minutes, the victim's stats changed back to normal,
but the victim gets a message, "You feel bad." and lost -2 hps, -3 mana,
-3 moves a total 2 times over the last 4 minutes. After this, the victim
was no longer subject to the poison.

- - Remark:\*\* The vial is enough to apply 8 times on a spear before
    being empty.

This seems to be a lessened or weaker, or older version of the hemlock
poison. Hemlock would be preferable in almost all cases. The benefits of
belladonna seem to be that all of the ingredients can be pretty easily
found, while hemlock requires inkberries which load only in the south of
the world. Useful to make casters and such use mana and time to cast
cure on themselves or their charmies. The 'poison' flag can still be
seen in 'stat' for the full 12 minutes although there is no noticeable
effect after the last tic of the poison at about 10 minutes.
