title: Trophy

Usage: **trophy** \[string\]

With this command you can see your trophy list, which contains the
number of times you have killed each kind of monster and player. The
more knowledge you have of a specific kind of creature, the fewer
[experience](experience "wikilink") points you will get.

You may get on trophy also PCs you personally didn't
[kill](kill "wikilink"). This can happen if a character of an enemy race
dies soon after meeting you.

Note that trophies fill up from the bottom, so your most recent new
kills are displayed on the first page. This will save you scrolling
through the entire trophy list.

Also, you can specify a string to only display entries whose names
contain that string. For example:

`trophy wolf`
`trophy elrond`
`trophy #      <- display all killed player characters`
