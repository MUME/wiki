\[Delayed Command\]

By using the "**camp**" command, you make a campfire at your present
location.

Campfires have both positive and negative effects:

- They lower the chance of people getting [ill](disease "wikilink")
  while sleeping in cold places.
- They allow you to [cook](cook "wikilink") food, if you are holding a
  [pan](pan "wikilink").
- Most animals will shy away from a lit campfire.
- Light and smoke from a campfire can be seen from far away (by typing
  "[look](look "wikilink") around") and therefore reveal your position
  to everyone else in the proximity.

Black Numenoreans can use the "camp [rent](rent "wikilink")" command in
order to leave the game, as well as "camp rent retire", "camp offer",
"camp offer retire".

Example:

` > camp`
