\[Delayed Command\]

By using the "camp" command, you make a campfire at your present
location.

Campfires have both positive and negative effects:

\- They lower the chance of people getting ill while sleeping in cold
places. - They allow you to cook food, if you are holding a pan. - Most
animals will shy away from a lit campfire. - Light and smoke from a
campfire can be seen from far away (by typing "look

` around") and therefore reveal your position to everyone else in the `
` proximity.`

Black Numenoreans can use the "camp rent" command in order to leave the
game, as well as "camp rent retire", "camp offer", "camp offer retire".

Example:

` > camp`
