title: "Libraries"

Libraries can be found in most towns of Arda and in some other places of
lore.

To read a book in a library, go to a library and try "look books". If
you get a list of books then you may read their contents. For instance
in Fornost, the current list reads: <nowiki>g

` >l books`

Since the rebuilding of Fornost, the Librarian in charge has done her
best to gather books from near and far to resupply the once splendid
library. Some of those obtained are:

` Combat`
` ======`

`   'MUME Combat'`
`       by Radorac II (TA 2853)`

`   'An Introduction to MUME Combat'`
`       by Petrel`

` History`
` =======`

`    'Of the Fall of the Northern Kingdom of Arnor and the Successor States'`
`       by Quenaire of Imladris`

</pre>

To read a book, you need to either <nowiki>g

` read `

<title>

or view

<title>
</pre>

where

<title>

is given above in quotes. You need specify only the initial part of the
title which makes it unique in the library: eg <nowiki>g

` read m   [reads the 1st Book 'MUME Combat', not case sensitive]`
` read a   [reads the 2nd Book 'An Introduction...' etc.] `

</pre>

If there's more than one book beginning with the same word, you need to
specify some entire words: for example, <nowiki>g

` read the stones   [and not 'read the st']`

</pre>

Certain books are divided into chapters: for these book, you can:
<nowiki>g

` read `

<title>

all - Read the entire book

` read `

<title>

contents - Read the book's introduction and index

` read `

<title>

chapter <N> - Only read chapter N - eg: read t chapter 5

</pre>

Note that books are written in a script based on the language used by
the author, so a book written by a man will probably be in Westron,
while one writen by an elf would be Sindarin or Quenya. If you have less
than 100% skill in that language, you will only be able to decipher some
of the text.

If you want to add a book of yours to a library, please read the News
board for some information, and contact Maedhros, Dain or another Vala
in order to receive writing guidelines.
