\> **examine spear**
This spear has a smooth wooden shaft, about five feet long, with a small
metal
tip at its top. Quality craftsmanship is obvious in the weapon's
balance - it
is perfectly weighted and very easy to handle. A leather wrap two feet
from the
bottom acts as a handgrip, with the emblem of a horse prominent in the
wood
just above.
\> **consider spear**
It is a steel-tipped spear (well-maintained, fresh).
This stabbing weapon can be wielded one-handed.
It is average while attacking and poor while defending; its speed is
slow, and it inflicts average damage
upon hitting.
It weighs three pounds.

This is an often under used weapon, the keep-at-bay feature of the
[stabbing weapons](stabbing_weapon "wikilink") group is very powerful
when harnessed correctly. Although the Steel-tipped spear is difficult
to obtain, once [enchanted](enchant "wikilink") it is a firm rival to
any [slashing weapon](slashing_weapon "wikilink") for all
[classes](class "wikilink").
