title: "Lead"
---

To move indoors with your mount, or to pass heavy undergrowth for
example, you might have to 'lead' your horse (or warg or whatever).
Typing "lead" while riding will automatically make you dismount and lead
your mount. Use "dismount" if you want the mount not to follow you.

If you are not riding and you type "lead" without any parameters, you
will try to lead any mount in the room that you have previously been
riding. Similarly, typing ride with no argument will cause you to mount
the animal you are leading, if possible.

It is also possible to lead mounts that you previously haven't ridden if
you specify which one you want to lead (like "lead horse"). This won't
work if someone else in the room is leading or riding the mount already.
