### In room

A thin, light longsword lies on the ground here.

### Examine

Although it has the length of a regular longsword, from its weight and
thin
blade it is evident that this sword is lighter. Moreover, its hilt is
not
pure metal, but rather has two large, dark, wooden pieces assembled upon
a
thin steel sheet. Even so, it looks finely tempered and thoroughly
balanced.
Metals are scarce in the Anduin Vales, and thus weapon smiths there
prefer to
forge lighter, handier weapons.

### Consider

It is a Beorning sword (flawless, fresh).
This slashing weapon can be wielded one-handed.
**Plain:** It is average while attacking and average while defending;
its speed is average, and it inflicts little damage upon hitting.
**Chant:** It is excellent while attacking and good while defending; its
speed is average, and it inflicts average damage upon hitting.
It weighs three pounds.
