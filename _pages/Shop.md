**Shop**s are places where the adventurer may purchase
[equipment](equipment "wikilink") for his quests, and where he may sell
his treasure if he should manage to survive the perils with his life and
sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific type of merchandise.
Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your [armour](armour "wikilink"),
even if it is of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop
by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The
shopkeepers are very capable of defending themselves, most would stop
you attacking before you'd even really begun.
