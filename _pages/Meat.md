**Meat** can be acquired by [butchering](butcher "wikilink") the
[corpses](corpse "wikilink") of some animals. It comes in four sizes:
morsel, small, regular and large. Meat can be [cooked](cook "wikilink")
using a [pan](pan "wikilink"), which has the effect of making it more
nutritious, making it last longer and reducing its weight slightly.
Having a chunk of [salt](salt "wikilink") in your inventory while
cooking preserves the meat even better. Although the name of the object
will be different depending on which animal it was gotten from (bear
meat, venison, wolf meat, etc.), all kinds of meat are functionally
identical.
