\> **look hauberk**

This chain mail hauberk consists of an uncountable amount of iron-rings.
Upon

closer inspection some half of the rings has a small gap between their
begin

and end, while the other half is solid; thereby compromising between
overall

qualtity and time as well as cost to create this armour.

\> **consider hauberk**

It is a chain mail hauberk.

It weighs eight pounds.
