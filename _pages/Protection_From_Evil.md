**Protection from Evil** is a level 4 [cleric](cleric "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). It temporarily makes evil creatures less
aggressive to you. Thus, it will take a little bit longer for them to
attack you and if you are in the same [room](room "wikilink") with other
players, who are not using this spell, [mobs](mob "wikilink") will
prefer to attack these instead.
