\> **look shield**

This shield is not exceptionally large, but it is very maneuverable. It
is

very light for its size, and on its front is a brilliant collage of gems

and precious metals.

\> **consider shield**

It is a bejewelled shield.

It weighs one stone and six pounds.

## Opinions

A very useful all-round shield commonly used by
[warriors](warrior "wikilink"), [scouts](scout "wikilink") and combos
alike. Few shields give more protection, and only one other can match it
at the same or even similar weight. They are also rumoured to enhance
the user's ability to resist [spells](spell "wikilink").
