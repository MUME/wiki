title: MUME:Wiki rules

Any player can edit any page!

Try to inline information instead of just linking to external
information. So instead of linking to a guide, try to talk to the author
of the guide and see if (s)he will permit copying it here. A link might
be better than nothing though.

## Content Rules

This wiki is a collection of mortal knowledge. If you learned about
something as a mortal character and want to share it you may add it as
long as you follow the spoiler rules. You may **NOT** add any
information that you learned as an Ainur.

## Spoiler Rules

You must always hide spoilers that will remove the joy of discovery for
players. This can be done by wrapping sensitive information in a spoiler
HTML tag. Examples of sensitive information are:

- Hidden door names
- Output from the identify spell
- Detailed information about how and where to get legendary equipment
- Detailed maps of new/remote/contested areas (detailed maps of cities
  are fine)

**Example:**

<spoiler> Secret information </spoiler>

<spoiler> Secret information </spoiler>
