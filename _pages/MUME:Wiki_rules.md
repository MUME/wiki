title: MUME:Wiki rules
---

The wiki is now up on <http://mume.org/wiki>. It is totally
unconfigured, but I manged to get MUME account integration in place at
least. This is proving to be a bit of hassle in phpbb3, but we'll get
there in the end.

If you want to edit anything on the wiki, you need to log in with a MUME
player name and matching account password. You can browse the wiki
without logging in though. Feel free to add any kind of reasonable
MUME-related content you want for now (but not too detailed guides, stat
information, cheat information, or anything else we do not really want
on our web pages).
