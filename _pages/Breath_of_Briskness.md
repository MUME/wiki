**Breath of Briskness** is a level 10 [cleric](cleric "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). If cast it gives a small boost to the move
points and increases move regeneration temporarily for everyone in the
same group and the same room with the caster.
This spell increases mobility significantly and can be a lifesaver if
you need to outrun chasing enemies. Clerics should practice it close to
maximum. Most [mages](mage "wikilink") use it too. The druid who lives
north-west of [Bree](Bree "wikilink") is known to be very skilled in
this spell.
