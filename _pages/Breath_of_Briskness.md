**Breath of Briskness** is a level 10 [cleric](cleric "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). If cast it gives a boost to the [move
points](Movement_Points "wikilink") and increases move regeneration
temporarily.

This spell increases [mobility](mobility "wikilink") significantly and
can be a lifesaver if you need to outrun chasing enemies or provide the
mobility to pursue fleeing enemies. Clerics should practice it close to
maximum. Most [mages](mage "wikilink") use it too. The druid who lives
north-west of [Bree](Bree "wikilink") is known to be very skilled in
this spell.

The spell is always cast without a target and will affect the caster and
automatically everyone who is both in the same group and in the same
room. This includes any mobs, such as [mounts](Mount "wikilink"),
charmies, or mercenaries.

The first effect is an immideate distribution of movement points. At
higher levels this can be roughly 50 points which are distributed to all
eligible targets. So the number of points for each individual will be
roghly 50/group size.

The second effect is to boost move point regeneration. This effect is
not reduced by the number of targets, so everyone will receive the full
effect regardless of group size. At higher levels the boost can last up
to 6 minutes and will be slightly stronger than the boost of a forest
green cloak. The effect will stack with any other move regen boosts,
such as equipment like the mentioned cloak, walking and travelling
herblores, and rest and sleep.
