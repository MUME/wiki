The **whois** command gives you some information about a player. You can
see his [race](race "wikilink"), his [class](class "wikilink") and
[level](level "wikilink") (unless he is
[incognito](incognito "wikilink")), his self-supplied description,
roughly from which part of the (real) world he is playing and about how
long he was last seen on MUME.

Members of the good races can't see whether a certain minion is playing,
nor vice versa.

Example: while playing a Dwarf, you would see...

\> whois frodo Frodo is a level one Hobbit Apprentice. Last login 2
hours ago from \*.edu \> whois trix Trix the Wabbit is a level
forty-eight Mountain Troll Warrior \[Retired\]. This silly old Wabbit
once wandered all over Arda: from Rivendell, to Bree, thru wittle
Hobbiton, and all the way to GreyHaven.

You can change the text shown on your "whois" by typing 'change whois'.
What you can write there is subject to certain rules: see [Rules
Whois](Rules_Whois "wikilink").
