\> **look greaves**
These greaves are forged out of durable, polished steel plates. They
cover the
entire leg except for the knees, where strong, interwoven chains attach
to the
upper and lower leg parts. Black leather laces at the back of the
greaves
enable them to be adjusted to the size of the leg. An engraved set of
buckles
at the top allows attachment to other pieces of armour.
\> **consider greaves**
They are a fine pair of metal greaves.
They weigh thirteen pounds.
