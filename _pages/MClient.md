## Description

mClient strives to be a modern, fully functional, and highly portable
mud client by replacing powwow's mostly Linux-only code with Qt
libraries thereby allowing it to run on any operating system supported
by the Qt framework (such as Windows or OS X). Since powwow was written
in C the main engine has been completely rewritten and has its functions
hooked through a C++ wrapper which handles all the information exchange
between the client and graphical interface. The wrapper also overtakes
the job as the proxy in MMapper2, essentially behaving as a pre-parser
that handles all the data extraction needed by the mapper.

## Features

- Javascript Scripting
- Highly Modular Plugin-based Design
- Powerful WebKit-based Display
- Portable to Windows, Linux, and OS X
- Mapper and Group Manager similar to MMapper2/Pandora
- Possibly Powwow Scripting and Remote Editing

The client is currently in beta.
