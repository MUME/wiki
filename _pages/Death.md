**Dying** on [MUME](MUME "wikilink") (except in the case of
[trolls](troll "wikilink") turned to stone by the sun) does not mean the
loss of all gains of the character. You can lose no more than the
[experience](experience "wikilink") for the last
[level](level "wikilink") in case of a mobdeath (in this case, your
[age](age "wikilink") also gets reset to your starting age). In case of
a pkill death, you lose less experience, but you also lose some
warpoints, if you have any. In some other cases (such as deaths in
[death traps](death_trap "wikilink")) you lose some [travel
points](travel_points "wikilink") instead.

If you did not die to a deathtrap, you may stand a chance at recovering
your [equipment](equipment "wikilink") from your
[corpse](corpse "wikilink"). However, whatever killed you may kill you
again if you are not cautious, and other players may also take your
items from the corpse. If you are below level 6 and of a good
[race](race "wikilink"), you are entitled to a new [newbie
kit](newbie_kit "wikilink") every time you die.

The kind of death a character suffers (mobdeath, pk, other) now depends
not only on the immediate cause of the death, but also on the recent
encounters of the dying character. Moreover, in case of pk, the code
takes into consideration recently met friends and foes - not only those
currently in the [room](room "wikilink").

More precisely:

- You suffer pk-death if you die when \*an Enemy\* is present, or soon
  after you encountered \*enemies\*, or soon after you received massive
  damage from a PC; no matter what the actual cause of death is. This
  means, if you drown, fall, or get whacked by a [mob](mob "wikilink")
  while escaping \*an Enemy\*, it is considered pk death. "Soon" and
  "while" depend on the specific conditions: on how many enemies you
  met, on how badly they wounded you, and so on.

<!-- -->

- Otherwise, you mobdie if a mob or same-side PC finishes you off after
  a mob severely damaged you. No more mercy-killings.

<!-- -->

- Otherwise, it's considered
  DT/[bloodlack](wound "wikilink")/falling/[drowning](drowning "wikilink")/whatever.

In case of pk-death, the number of war points transferred depends both
on the friends and enemies in the room, and (somewhat less) on those
recently met. If you escape a huge fight and are finished off by a lucky
level 1 enemy, that level 1 will not gain huge amounts of war points.
Conversely, the enemies you were fleeing from will gain some.
