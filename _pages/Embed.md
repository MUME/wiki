Some artisans all around Arda are able to EMBED items into
[staves](Staff "wikilink"). Metallic bands will make the staff harder,
hence making it grant better physical protection. Gems will instead
boost an enchanted staff's magical powers, the effect depending on which
gem is embedded.

Not every artisan will be able to embed everything: in general,
armourers and weaponsmiths will be able to embed metals, jewellers will
embed gems.

Example: \> embed bar in staff

You cannot embed more than a certain number of items on a given staff,
and embedding an item is a definitive choice - you cannot pull the item
out and replace it with another.

In order to embed gems into a staff it needs to be enchanted. A staff
can only hold a total of 3 gems and there are limitations on how many
gems of a particular class can be embedded. For instance, a staff can
only hold 1 usable gem. Similarly, an enchanted staff can only hold 1
major gem but adding a focus increases this to 2 major gems.
