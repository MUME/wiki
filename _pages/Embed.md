Some artisans all around Arda are able to EMBED items into staves.
Metallic bands will make the staff harder, hence making it grant better
physical protection. Gems will instead boost an enchanted staff's
magical powers, the effect depending on which gem is embedded.

Not every artisan will be able to embed everything: in general,
armourers and weaponsmiths will be able to embed metals, jewellers will
embed gems.

Example: \> embed bar in staff

You cannot embed more than a certain number of items on a given staff,
and embedding an item is a definitive choice - you cannot pull the item
out and replace it with another.
