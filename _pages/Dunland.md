Dunland is a land south of [Eregion](Eregion "wikilink"), north of
[Rohan](Rohan "wikilink") and west of [Isengard](Isengard "wikilink").
It is inhabited by [Dunlendings](Dunlendings "wikilink"). Most
Dunlendings are xenophobic and will attack non-humans on sight. The men
of Dunland are simple and cannot tell the difference between free men
and the odd [Black Numenorean](Black_Numenorean "wikilink") in service
to the Dark Lord. Even men, however, should not necessarily expect a
warm welcome in the villages, towns, and homes of Dunlending warriors
and chieftains.
