Most meat found in the wild will be raw. It is possible to increase both
its nurishment value and its lifetime by cooking it. It is also possible
to cook fish.

To do this, you must hold a pan, have raw meat in your inventory, and a
fire or fireplace must be in the room. Type 'cook meat', and you will
cook the meat. If the piece of meat is not small, and you also have salt
in your inventory, then you will cure the meat, making it last even
longer.

Note that meat from humanoids does not cook well.
