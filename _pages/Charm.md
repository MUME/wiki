**Charm** is a level 14 [mage](mage "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). When cast upon a creature it will try to gain
mental control over it. If successful the caster will be able to command
the charmed creature (also called charmie) for some time. To command the
charmie the charmer also needs to have some experience in the
[command](command "wikilink") skill which is taught by the
[ranger](ranger "wikilink") [guilds](guilds "wikilink").

The following is an example for issuing a command: <nowiki>g order
followers groan

</pre>

The more active charmies a caster already has, the harder it becomes to
successfully charm another one. Thus, you will hardly see casters with
more than two charmies. Sleeping creatures are more susceptible to
charm. For difficult charmies it can therefore be easier to use the
[Sleep](Sleep "wikilink") spell first.

Charmies still maintain their old aggressiveness against all other
players except the caster. Only few powerful creatures can therefore be
used in groups and charmies are primarily used as buffers, bashers, or
parry splitters for solo hunting.
