**Charm** is a [level](level "wikilink") 14 [mage](mage "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). When cast upon a
[creature](mobile "wikilink") it will try to gain mental control over
it. If successful the caster will be able to command the charmed
creature (also called charmie) for some time. To command the charmie the
charmer also needs to have some experience in the
[command](command "wikilink") skill which is taught by the
[ranger](ranger "wikilink") [guilds](guilds "wikilink").

Example:

`> cast 'charm' rabbit`

The following is an example for issuing a command:

`> order followers groan`

The more active charmies a caster already has, the harder it becomes to
successfully charm another one. Thus, you will hardly see casters with
more than two charmies. [Sleeping](Sleep "wikilink") creatures are more
susceptible to charm. For difficult charmies it can therefore be easier
to use the [Sleep](Sleep_Spell "wikilink") spell first. Charm will
eventually wear off (after roughly one rl hour) and to refresh the
charm, it is best to first order the charmie to sleep.

Charmies still maintain their old aggressiveness against all other
players except the caster. Charmies (or the vast majority of mobs) will
target the first person in a room, so if the charmer is that first
person, charmies won't hit anyone without orders. If, however, another
player is the first person, an aggressive charmie will automatically
attack. This mechanic makes using aggresive charmies with other grouped
players hard to manage. Only few charmies exist that are both powerful
and non aggressive. Charmies are thus primarily used as
[buffers](buffer "wikilink"), [bashers](bash "wikilink"), or
[parry](parry "wikilink") splitters for solo hunting.

Guards in most [cities](city "wikilink") will attack charmed mobiles.

In PK charmies do not see an enemy player under their name but not under
the keyword like orc or \*orc\* so you either need to use k <name> or
just hit the target first and order the charmie to assist.
