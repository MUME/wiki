Some special rules apply to trolls:

- Trolls are not allowed to make a career of killing other darkies
  (including

` trolls) in or near Warrens, due to abuse of how easy it is to do so.`

To clarify this, the Zaugurz Orcs do not count as darkies in this
context. They have declared war on the Tarkhnarb and their allies, so it
is allowed - even encouraged - for trolls to kill them (at any time and
location).

As you can now see time from the account menu, it is no longer allowed
to logon a level 1 troll to check time after linkloss or crash.
