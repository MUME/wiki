title: "Flip"
---

If you feel particularly happy, you can flip head over heels, or flip
someone else to make him dizzy.

If, on the other hand, you don't know what alternative to take, you can
FLIP COIN, and see whether it lands tails or heads up.

This is one way of deciding how to split equipment (from
[PK](PK "wikilink") or [Smobs](Super_Mobile "wikilink")).
