---

If you feel particularly happy, you can **flip** head over heels, or
flip someone else to make him dizzy.

If, on the other hand, you don't know what alternative to take, you can
'flip coin', and see whether it lands tails or heads up.

This is one way of deciding how to split
[equipment](equipment "wikilink") (from [PK](PK "wikilink") or
[Smobs](Super_Mobile "wikilink")).
