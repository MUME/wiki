A program that automatically creates a visual representation of MUME's
world is called a mapper. Usually it allows you to show your current
position, the terrain, remembers doors, some mappers allow to display
guilds, shops, places of fresh water or other information.

If you encounter problems in setting up a mapper or using it, please do
not ask via pray for help from the immortals. Use the site/email-address
of your mapper's developers to ask questions, sometimes mortals can help
if you "narrate" about it.
