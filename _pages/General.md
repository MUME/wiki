**General [skills](skill "wikilink")** (also known as
**[ranger](ranger "wikilink") skills**) refers to a set of skills that
players can learn at a ranger [guild](guild "wikilink"). Despite the
name, there is no ranger [class](class "wikilink"), and these skills can
be practiced by any class without penalty.
