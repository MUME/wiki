**Inns** are places where the weary traveller may rest while the
innkeeper (also know as '[receptionist](receptionist "wikilink")') looks
after his [equipment](equipment "wikilink") and treasure. Specifically,
you may use an inn to store your gathered equipment while you are not
playing the game (we all have to sleep sometimes, there is no shame in
that).

Some smaller towns are very suspicious of more powerful people, and will
refuse to keep you.
