It is forbidden for more than one person to use the same keyboard at the
same time. This is to prevent people from "logging on the character of a
friend" or whatnot. (Remember: Linkless players are still considered to
be playing.)

NOTE: The 5- and 30-minute rules also apply to each keyboard. Individual
players must use a different keyboard if they wish to play the same side
within 5 minutes or opposite sides within 30 minutes. Sadly, lab
computers are an exception to this rule, because the player may not know
who used the same keyboard 15 minutes earlier. However, this is not a
license to cheat. (Principle: When in doubt, wait.)

Furthermore, [Rules Separation](Rules_Separation "wikilink") applies to
any single computer or a computer lab.
