title: Change Class
tags: ["Help files"]

In some other MUD, players are required to pick a "class" when they
create a new character; the character's abilities depend on the class.
MUME works in the opposite way: a character's class depends on whatever
skills the character decided to learn.

At any time, you can type 'change class' and see a list of titles that
match your skills, race, alignment, history, and so on. 'Change class X'
to choose a new class. Your choice only affects where you appear on
'[who warr](who "wikilink")', '[who cleric](who "wikilink")'..., and
your [whois](whois "wikilink").

When you practice new [skills](skill "wikilink") or you gain/lose
[levels](level "wikilink"), your class might be automatically changed,
if the one you selected earlier doesn't fit you anymore.

For example:

`>change class`
`You may choose among the following titles:`
`  Priest`
`  Scholar`
`  Rider`
`  Healer`
`  Master Healer`
`  ...`
`>change class healer`
`Ok.`
