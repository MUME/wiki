## General

**Movement**

- There does not seem to be any racial terrain modifiers to movement for
  mobs (e.g., player Orcs have a move penalty in forests, but mob Orcs
  do not seem to)

**Equipment**

- Testing seems to indicate that mobs do not benefit from wearing boots
  (i.e., no measureable movereduction)
- Mobs do not appear to benefit from wearing +moveregen equipment (e.g.
  FGC)

## List of Useful Charm-able Mobs

### Comparison of Mob Stats and Skills

**Notes**

- Relative MPs are compared to those of a mother eagle, and represent
  "distance until mob runs out of moves (distance until mob rests)"
- Relative HPs are compared to those of a mother eagle
- Attack and defense flags are not a complete list for each mob, but
  rather ones relevant to use as a charmie in PvP or PvE

### Notes on Individual Mobs

- For load spots please use publicly available mapped files(for example
  <http://faine.epizy.com/?i=1>), CTRL+F, filter all (or filter contents
  is probably better) and search for the mob's long description
  (included below). For example mountain troll's long desc is "A
  grey-skinned mountain troll stands here."
