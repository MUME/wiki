The master of a house can instruct his guards and gatekeeper about which
other people are to be welcomed into the house. This is done via the
FRIENDS command.

friends list - Display current friends friends add <name1> <name2> ... -
Give someone free access to the house friends remove <name1> <name2>
... - Remove the welcome status

These commands must be used while in the same room as your valet or
guards.

NOTE: You are not allowed to add players of the opposite side of the
race war.
