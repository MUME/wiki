When you get tired of bashing monsters with your fists, you might
consider **wielding** a [weapon](weapon "wikilink").

Example: wield sword

Be careful about wielding weapons in a [town](town "wikilink") if you're
not a [citizen](citizen "wikilink")!

Some weapons can be wielded one or two handed. Wield it as normal, and
then type "wield 2" to grasp it in two hands, or "wield 1" to hold it in
one hand.
