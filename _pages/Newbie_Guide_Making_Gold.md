**Guides Newbie Making Gold**

The goal of this guide is to help newer players to get coins and make
gold.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at:

<https://mume.org/help/help_index>

First is about the coins in the game themselves. Depending on what race
you play the coins may have names in a different language, such as the
elven tongues.

**Copper = busc, Silver = Celeb, Gold = Lauren**

Then the rates of conversion between coins. **100 copper = 1 silver, 20
silver = 1 gold** There are other types of treasures as well, such as
silver rings, gems, jewels, jewerly, etc...

One source of earning coins is to complete a **quest** in the game. Many
quests give coins as a reward, or give items that you may end up selling
for some money.

Another is looting coins from different areas of the map. Some rooms
load coins simply laying on the ground. In other rooms they may be
hidden and you have to **reveal coin**. Sometimes the coins will load in
a container, such as a box, crate, chest, etc. You might have to open
the container to examine it first, or even need to **pick** it open if
it's locked.

Coins also load on many of the humanoid mobs in the game. They often
have copper and silver coins to loot, and rarely gold coins. Other
treasures such as gold or silver rings can be found as well. Sometimes
these treasures may load in a pouch or a backpack, so you might want to
loot those and **examine** them as well.

**Tips for Saving Money**

One way to keep gold in your pocket is to not spend it in the first
place. For example several towns in the game have pet shops where you
can **buy** mounts. But some of these mounts are very expensive for a
new character. Mounts load for free in many areas of the game, so using
free mounts is a fast way to save money. Ponies, donkeys (not a very
good mount), mules, and pack horses load on farms, ranches, stables, and
other areas. Learning a few mount load spots can save you alot of money.

**Rent** has been recently adjusted to be more affordable. But you can
still do some things to lower your renting costs. Wearing your most
expensive gear when you rent, reduces the price of your rent. Also
hoarding and holding on to lots of gear or items can raise your rent
price. So if you can, sell extra items before you rent. You can always
use the **offer** command at an inn to check to see how much it will
cost you.

Free food loads in many places in the game, homes, camps, in stoves,
crates, farms, even in towns. There are even berries, fruits, and
vegetables that load in many areas. You can always butcher a corpse and
eat meat for free. Eating for free saves you a little money. Drinking
from wells springs, rivers, and fountains is also free.

Lastly, free gear loads in many areas of the map. A free pail or water
skin, free blankets, lanterns, large sacks, rope, torches, whetstones,
etc... Even items like saddles, swords, and shields can be found if you
know where to look. And if you are not going to use it, you can always
**sell** it. Speaking of whetstones, you can use them to sharpen and
**mend** swords, daggers, axes, spears, etc for free. Instead of paying
to have a weaponshop mend them for you. **Hold** the stone in your hand
or **wear** the stone on your belt to use it. Then type **whet**. When
you whet a weapon it is delayed and takes a little bit of time and some
moves. It also forces you to sit down, so stand back up.

**Protecting your Gold**

Several mobs in the game can steal your coins, from a few silver up to
many gold coins. The chance for them to successfully steal from you is
based off of your Perception and any practices you have in Awareness
skill. They can only steal coins from your pockets, so to protect them
you can use a moneybag. You can buy a moneybag from some shops, or loot
one off of a mob in the game. Moneybags can be put in other containers
you have, say a sack or a backpack or worn on your belt. Moneybags can
hold up to 100 gold coins, but can even hold other treasures such as
valuable gems or rings. If coins are in a moneybag mobs cannot steal
those coins from you.

**Looting Items to Sell**

One thing to keep in mind while selling at shops is an items weight.
Some items might sell for a couple of silver, but could weigh over 16
pounds! That is very heavy loot to carry around. It's often much more
efficient to carry more light weight items to sell. So a barrel full of
beer is worth some money, but not really worth the weight for how heavy
it is. A simple chest can sell for 8 silver, but it's very heavy to haul
it miles back to town. Same with boats. If you are really hard up for
silver, you can still try selling those items if you need to. If you are
worried about how heavy an item is for looting you can always
**consider** item, which will tell you it's weight. You can use con for
short. con shield, con sword, con barrel

If you are looting alot of items, using containers can be very useful.
Backpacks and large sacks are often used of this. You can put alot of
light weight or many medium weight items in a backpack or large sack
before it is full. That increases the number of items you can carry.
Using a mount to help you haul loot is also very popular. You can give
heavier items to a mount to carry, like shields or axes you've looted.
Then later when you are near a store, you can unsaddle those items from
the mount so you can sell them. To see what items your mount is
carrying, just examine mount. An important part of this process is to
label your mount. It is very easy to confuse one pack horse with
another, and labeling helps to keep it organized.

Alias can make looting to much faster, and you will likely see other
players doing this. Some examples of alias you might want to try: alias
for get coins all.corpse alias for exam corpse, exam 2.corpse, exam
3.corpse alias for butcher corpse, butcher 2.corpse, butcher 3.corpse

Some players even set alias for get all.shield all.corpse or get
all.sword all.corpse

**Making Money by Selling at Shops**

The primary way, other then looting, for making money is by selling
items at shops. There are many types of shops in the game: weapon shop,
armour shop, combination weapon and armour shop, herbalist, grocer,
general and/or traveler shops, tailors, and jewelery shops. There are
even some specialty shops that are somewhat more specific like: archery
shops, boat captains that buy and sell boats, pet shops, pawn shops,
bartenders, bakers, smoking shops, or even a poison vendor!

Some shops only sell items, and will not buy anything from you. Some
shops are very picky about what the will buy and what they won't. Most
specialty shops only by very specific items, such as boats at a captain,
or plants and herbs at an herbalist. Some shops are less choosy about
what the buy like some of the pawn shops or grocers. A few shops tend to
not buy items from certain races in the game, like most elf shops refuse
orcish items. If you are not sure if a shop will buy something or not,
there is a command for that. The **value** command will let you know if
they will buy it AND how much money they will offer for it if they will
buy it.

This is just a list of examples of all the items you can possibly sell
at shops: berries, mushrooms, weapons, shields, armour, cloaks, belts,
pelts and furs, musical instruments, metal ores, barrels (heavy), rings,
cooked meats, and much much more

One thing to be aware of is the condition of items can really effect the
price you can get at a shop. Type **help states** to learn more about
it. Weapons and armour that are fresh and flawless sell for MUCH MORE
then the same item that is neglected and old. In fact if some gear is in
really bad shape, you might just skip it for looting because the price
may not be worth the weight.

For selling shields and armour there are some patterns to the prices.
Here is a list of some general guidelines going from cheapest to items
with a better price.

armour: cloth -\> soft leather -\> rigid leather -\> chain mail/scale
mail -\> metal armour: normal -\> sturdy -\> fine

So a cheap piece of armour would be a normal soft leather gloves. A very
valuable armour would be a fine metal greaves.

shield: small/target -\> large -\> full -\> large+full -\> wall shield:
wooden -\> metal

So a cheap shield would be a small wooden target shield. A valuable
shield would be a large metal full shield.

There are many other shields and armours in the game. A good way to get
an idea of how expensive some of them are is to type **list** in an
armour shop and look for patterns in cost. Generally the price goes up
as the weight goes up for shields and armour.

Some other ways to make money other then looting gear is **mine** and
**butcher**. When you butcher animals you'll very often get some meat
and maybe some furs or pelts. Furs and pelts are somewhat heavy, but a
pile of them can sell for alot of silver. Meat does not sell for very
much. If you **cook** it to smoke it, or cook it with salt to cure it,
the price goes up and it gets lighter to carry. Use a pan and a
campfire, and maybe some salt to try to get more copper and silver out
of your cooking. You can also give wolf and warg furs to secretaries in
cities for some silver coin rewards.

Mining is another way to make some money, check out help mining. You
will need a pick or a mattock to mine, and a way to carry it. Alot of
ore can get heavy fast. Also check to make sure which shops will buy the
ore before you do too much mining. Some shops will not buy raw ore. It
takes alot of moves to do some mining, so you might need to rest now and
again. The rooms in caves, mines, and tunnels you choose to mine it has
a LARGE impact on the quality of ore. So if you find a room that's a
good spot, make note of it. But don't spend too much time in a room that
isn't give you very good results. It will mostly waste time and moves.

Here the pattern of least to most valuable.

mining: iron ore (most common) -\> copper ore -\> silver nuggets -\>
gold nuggets

Another wonderful way to make some money is herbalist shops! Herbs are a
great way to make piles and piles of silver. The primary reason is they
are very light weight, you can carry alot of them back to town to sell
at the herbalist. Some plants you just get right up off the ground, but
most plants will need crushed first. Type **crush** plant when you find
one to check to see if it crushes. A picked plant might weight like 3-4
pounds, but after it is crushed the leaves weigh very little and sell
for often the same amount, maybe even more. So keep an eye out for
plants, a majority of them sell, and some for a very good price. Some
flowers and plants won't sell, but you can figure them out as you try to
make money.

**Spending Gold "I Made Money, Now What Do I Do With It?"**

The first thing to make sure you have money for is renting. If you are
rented at an inn and do not have enough money to cover your **rent**,
the innkeepers will take all of your gear to cover the cost of your
rent. You can buy it back but it is expensive and there is a time limit.
So be sure you have money enough to cover your rent costs.

When spending money at shops, you really do not need to worry about any
thing that costs only copper or a few silver. Those items are CHEAP.
Don't worry about the small costs, because selling one sword or shield
can probably buy you a brand new lantern and 20 flasks of oil and still
have silver left over.

Next buy any adventuring gear you do not have. Make sure you have a
belt, a hunting knife or a butcher knife, a water skin, a lantern with a
spare flask of oil, a good pair of boots. Being stuck in the dark or not
being able to butcher can really slow you down.

You will also want to make sure you have some money for mending armour
and shields at the shop. Cheaper items costs much less to **mend**, but
metal items and some shields can be expensive to mend. You might also
need to **resize** armour and shields as you find some upgrades, which
can cut into your budget a little bit.

You might need a few silver to cover some travel expenses. There are
some ferries in the game that cost silver for a ride. Also coach tickets
you can buy to travel from Fornost to Bree to Tharbad, with stops
inbetween.

Next get a good weapon that you are planning on using. That is how you
will get most of your starting xp. A shield for defense. It is just fine
if you don't have the best weapon and shield in the game. You'll earn
enough over time to upgrade what you do have. You can always sell the
old ones at a shop when you are done with them. If you are planning on
using a bow, you'll also have to budget for arrows because they can
break or become lost. But don't worry too much, over all arrows are
pretty affordable. Some areas even have arrows that load for free!

A very popular item that many players save up for is a magical 'red
ruby'. It is a somewhat common magical item that is very light weight.
You can wear it in a neck slot, freeing up a belt slot, or wear it on
your belt. It permanatly glows with a magical light, so you can get rid
of your heavy lantern and flasks of oil. Which means you can carry more
loot! A very useful upgrade especially for lower strength characters.
Shop for them in jewelry stores. There is a jewelry shop in Blue
Mountains, Grey Havens Forlond, Rivendell, and Lorien.

You might also want to buy a more expensive mount at a pet shop and a
saddle for it. Also renting mounts at a stable costs some silver. But it
does save you having to run around and trying to find free mounts, and
it's always right there and ready to go as soon as you are. Mounts
rented at a stable keep their saddles on as well.

Save up for citizenships. Bree, Fornost, and Tharbad all cost gold to
get a citizenship in. Bree and Fornost both cost 1 gold per level, so
you can save money by buying them early. There might be some quests you
can find that can help you get a Bree citzenship as well. Tharbad
citizenship is very expensive, so you'll need to save up if you want
that one. Many characters never purchase a Tharbad citizenship. You can
also spend money trying to bribe the guards in Tharbad to see if they
will let you in, even if you are not a citizen.

Some players also purchase pets or hire mercenaries to help them in a
fight. Mercenaries ask for payment every day they are with you. Pets
only cost money the first time you buy them, and if you rent them at a
stable, some silver to get them back out.

There are many other things you might need to save up money for. Buying
lockpicks or even upgrading lockpicks after you buy them. Upgrading your
gear in shops, like your cloak, or shield, or armour. Using money to
trade with other players for items. Maybe even buying your way into an
exclusive guild to practice.

It is always better to have some extra gold, then to run out and not
have enough.
