title: Unload
---

If you have a [crossbow](crossbow "wikilink"), you can
[Load](Load "wikilink") it with a bolt before using it in combat. This
makes your first shot much faster, as you only need to aim and fire.

You can recover your missile with [Unload](Unload "wikilink"), and check
if a crossbow is loaded by looking at it.

Some examples:

\>load 2.crossbow You load a bolt into your crossbow. \>load (loads the
crossbow you're wielding) But your crossbow is already loaded! \>look in
crossbow It is loaded with a bolt. \>unload You recover a bolt from a
crossbow.
