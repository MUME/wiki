\> **look cudgel**
This short, heavy club is about two and a half feet long. It is little
more than part of a thick tree limb which has been crudely finished;
the bark has been removed, and one end has been shaped into a hand
grip.
\> **consider cudgel**
It is a cudgel.
This crushing weapon can be wielded one-handed.
It is awful while attacking and average while defending; its speed is
average, and it inflicts very little damage upon hitting.
It weighs a couple of pounds.
