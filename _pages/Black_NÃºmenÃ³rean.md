In J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional prehistory of the
[world](Arda "wikilink"), the **Black Númenóreans** were
[men](men "wikilink") of Númenórean descent that dwelt on the coasts of
[Middle-earth](Middle-earth "wikilink") below the River Anduin from the
late Second Age onwards. The Black Númenóreans were originally among the
survivors from a human kingdom that had yet been, Númenor, which was
destroyed by Eru in the late Second Age.

The origin of the first black Númenóreans is in the latter half of the
Second Age. Lovers of power over lesser men, these Númenóreans became
corrupted by [Sauron](Sauron "wikilink"), coming to hate all good
peoples. They settled in Middle-earth, mainly in Umbar and surrounding
coastal regions.

After Sauron's downfall at the beginning of the Third Age, the
bloodlines of these Numenorean descendants mixed with other peoples,
especially the Haradrim over which they had dominion. During the first
millenia of the age, they proved strong enemies of the
[Dúnedain](Dúnedain "wikilink") of Gondor, but were permanently
scattered when Umbar was taken in TA 933, and when the subsequent siege
was broken in TA 1050.

As men, they are imposing in their height, with angular features. They
also make strong warriors, proud of their heritage. Thus they still
retain many of the ancient characteristics of the Edain, like their
cousins the Dunedain.

## Black Númenóreans in [Mume](MUME "wikilink")

MUME Black Numenoreans are wanderers from the far southern lands. They
are allied with [orcs](Orc "wikilink") and [trolls](Troll "wikilink")
who directly or indirectly serve the will of
[Sauron](Sauron "wikilink").

BN's have a number of penalties:

- They cannot become immortal.
- They generally have worse stats than other men.
- They have no cities in which to rent. However, they can
  [camp](camp "wikilink") outside and often do not pay rent.
- They must wander in search of those guildmasters of theirs who have
  made the trip to Eriador. No warrior guildmasters have ever been
  found, so their weapon skills are limited.
- When they die they return to a secret place and pray for a new life.
  Where they find themselves afterwards, only the Ainur know.
- They can suffer from depression.
- A BN will see free peoples by name or race only eg. \*an Elf\*. They
  can however see and group both [orcs](Orc "wikilink") and
  [trolls](Troll "wikilink"), thus proving to be valuable aides.
