In J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional prehistory of the world (Arda), the
Black Númenóreans were men of Númenórean descent that dwelt on the
coasts of Middle-earth below the River Anduin from the late Second Age
onwards. The Black Númenóreans were originally among the survivors from
a human kingdom that had yet been, Númenor, which was destroyed by Eru
in the late Second Age.
