# Staff, Gems and Focus guide

- Thank you to p Elestir, p Breaux, p Robal, p Feur, p Quartermain and
  the contributors to the private wiki for help with the initial version
  of this guide. Please feel free to directly change or add information.
- MUME's gem system was completely reworked quite recently, there has
  been some confusion about new options. The aim of this guide is to
  provide all available options about how to build and customize your
  character.

## New Rules

The new staff system can get a little confusing, it is much easier by
remembering these rules:

:# **All staves have always 3 slots to embed** (Carved Oak Staff from
Carpenter and Rough Staff from NOC apprentices for BNs and Trolls):
these 3 slots on **non-enchanted** staff can only be filled with metals
and not gems. That's how trolls can embed chunk+HSB+iron to get +25PB
staff that they can hold while hitting unarmed. Trolls with shield have
reduced damage, staff held offhand doesn't count as shield: "hold staff
as shield" is the command

:# **Enchanted staff can have gems embedded: you can embed maximum 1
major gem and 2 minor gems.** You could now also embed 3 minor gems. You
could also still embed 3 metals, metals take up the slot for gems.
**Enchanted staff can be worn only by the person who did the enchant.**

:# **Focused staff can have maximum 2 major gems embedded.** The third
slot can be filled by either a minor gem or a metal.

:# **A staff can have a maximum of 1 usable gem**(onyx-drain mana,
polished white quartzite-bless group, small green stone-create food or
pitch black spinel-group shroud)

:# You can use **"dismantle"** to change embedded gems and metals.

## Basics

- Perfect Oak branch loads in 8 potential trees, only 2 trees load at
  the same time. Take it to the carpenter (BM gates - 2e s 2e s 2e s e
  2s 3w 2s e), then enchant carved oak staff(only you can enchant it)
  - NOC: 4e rubble
  - WNOC: from slab n d e 4n e s e
  - FOY: nearby in "Center of the circle"
  - Khuzur: 4s 1e 1s 2w 1n from thorns/hedge
  - Tall orc: brush 1n all e 1w
  - Dunland Vellum: from entrance: w n 2e n e
  - Niuldor: 1s 3e from Grotburg entrance
  - Emyn: from mother eagle: 2d e 2n 1u 1e
- Bless staff/ring/topaz/helmet/adamant and blue crystal. Items can be
  blessed by someone else.
- Find Cirdan, say “sail west”(need align "You must have been sent on
  Arda to free it from the sorrows that weigh upon it" and lvl 21). This
  ship arrives at midnight every night.
- In Valinor board ferry, then go: s u n 2w u 2w 4s 4w 5s u e 2u. To
  create focus: “cast 'create focus' <item>”, where <item> is
  staff/ring/topaz/helmet/adamant and you need to have blue crystal in
  inventory.
- If you are creating a focused ring or crystal phial dip it into one of
  the 3 pools before casting 'create focus', when it's the right time
  the pool will start glowing
  - Sun pool. Ring +5OB. Phial: read below. Pool glows on sunrise. Pool
    location from creating focus: 2d w d
  - Star pool. Ring +5DB. Phial: read below. Glows on sunset. From Ferry
    s u n w
  - Moon pool. Ring +10 attack spell and -10 spellsave. Phial: read
    below. Glows on moonrise(happens every 25min). Before boarding
    Ferry: w u e e u
- Then sail back and embed gems into staff jeweller shop and metals in
  armourer's: for example "embed opal staff". You can embed 3 things and
  all must be different.

## Staff focus

- **Staff gives spell speed bonus and decreases spell mana cost.**
- Embedded metal doesn't increase OB unless you wield staff two-handed.
- You can't bash with a weapon in one hand and staff held in other hand
- Staff without embeds weighs 11.4lbs
- Maxenchant for staves adds + 5 PB, 1 damage, Saving Spell -10.
- Focused staff has Glow
- After embedding description of staff changes: carved -\> reinforced
  (if more metal than gems) or bejewelled (otherwise), BN staff changes
  from rough -\> metal-shod/inlaid with gems.

## Ancient Jewelled Helmet focus

- Ancient Jewelled Helmet is very light(6lbs) high absorption helmet by
  itself. Identify:
  - Ancient, jewelled helmet Weight: 6lbs Abs. 92% to: 14 Magic, Bless,
    Anti-evil, Anti-neutral, Nosell, Focus
- Ancient Jewelled Helmet is the focused version Ancient Metal Helmet.
- This is excellent choice for focus for combos and warriors, the main
  downside of Ancient Metal Helmet is that it's quite difficult to get
  compared to making a staff. For some combos helmet focus is better
  than staff focus though.
- **Ancient jewelled helmet gives you bonus on spell mana cost but not
  on spell speed like focused staff does.**
- You can put 1 major gem into Ancient Jewelled Helmet
- You don't need to enchant Ancient Metal Helmet to create focus

## Ring focus

- These rings can be focused: iron ring, ruby ring, copper ring, banded
  ring, and a jewelled ring (any type). The stats of the focused ring
  depend which pool you choose to dip the ring in.
- Ring focus is excellent choice mainly for warriors and scouts.
- The most popular ring focus is DB Sapphire(+10DB), next is OB
  Sapphire(+10OB), next focused banded ring sapphire(+8DB +3OB) or (+8OB
  +3DB)- harder to get this banded ring. +5OB and +5DB is also a good
  choice.
- Negative of ring focus is that you can't wear manaring/ruby
  ring/copper with it

##### Focused jewelled ring

- You can still do "use ring" and they do not have the negative effect
  when removing it. Here is a list of different jewelled rings in game
  together with their negative effects:
  - red ruby - manaregen +4, affects you by 'lethargy' when you remove
    it (slows manaregen and -10 attack spell)
  - topaz - str spell (can be up to +3) once per day, affects you by
    'tiredness' when you remove it (1.5x slower moveregen for 4 ticks)
  - garnet - cure critic 3x per day, affects you by 'hagardness' when
    you remove it (-5 ob)
  - opal - scouting ring (allows you search adjacent rooms for enemies,
    blinds you at beginnings of next 6 ticks when you remove it); to use
    it - 'use opal-ring
    <dir>

    '
  - emerald - remove poison, affects you by 1-2 random poisons when you
    remove it (unless you save - thus orcs can get no poison at all).
    Also seems to have a better chance of saving the longer you wear it.
- Focused jewelled ring is probably one of the least popular choices for
  foci, you would need a very niche combo to choose this focus over
  alternatives.
- Elestir: I think focusing a jewelled ring is a mistake, 10db ring is
  far too strong and so is staff

##### Focused copper ring

- Probably the weakest choice of all focus alternatives.

##### Focused banded ring

- The most powerful focus base ring is banded ring with +3OB +3DB, also
  harder to get, drops in Unqalome
- Banded rings can be:
  - OB +5
  - DB +5
  - Saving Spell -10 and Attack Spell +10
  - OB +3, DB +3 THE BEST
- Focused banded ring does not have the curse effect that a banded ring
  normally has

## Small crystal phial focus

- Adamant is the item you focus(Loads: Dragon) to create small crystal
  phial
- Small crystall phial with focus has -20 spellsave
- Phial is worn as necklace.
- **Phial dipped in Star pool** is bless/room-bless (duration of bless
  is 9:30, not sure about room-bless). If used on single target, it
  recharges in 3:00. (from Elestir)
- **Phial dipped in Sun pool** is curse/room-curse (relatively short
  duration, even shorter for room-curse and relatively long recharge
  times). (from Elestir)
  - The effect of curse is to lower opponent's OB and spellsave
- **Phial dipped in Moon pool** has an unknown effect to me, but it
  seems to give evil aligned enemies in room special flag (- wrath of
  Elbereth or something like that). Affected target didn't notice any
  other effects though and the duration was very short. Rumor has it
  that moon-phial is some sort of dispel magic against evil
  targets.(from Elestir)
  - Feur: I think it's more like black breath for evils(Black breath
    makes victims lose mana and moves. Some of that mana flows to the
    caster who receives a boost in energy, healing wounds and greater
    mobility)
- Elestir: Only beornings have good use for phial, scouts can go phial
  also sometimes. Phial gives permanent protection from evil(takes a LOT
  longer for mobs to autohit you), -20 save spell and eff vs mental, and
  is very resistant to darkening such as by claw in moria (will only get
  darkened for few seconds unlike staves); so it is interesting option
  for scouts who want to backstab darkies at mobs, as even if mobs
  eventually search you out, they may not interrupt the backstab because
  of protection from evil sometimes

## PBS Focus

- Topaz is the item you focus(Loads: Mormaeg, Wooden statues in
  Woodhall, in Eregion)
- PBS Focus works like regular PBS(Gives x amount HP/Mana/MP) but is
  more potent
- Popular for bears because they can't wear equipment
- Elestir: In some specific group setups pbs foci can be useful (such as
  sanc/quaking group which needs to sanc up and pbs on caster in order
  to fight), but they could just as well use purple scrolls and go with
  other focus.

*\* Does anyone have IDENTIFY for focused pale blue stone?*

## Gems

### Major gems(from best to worst subjectively)

##### Polished agate

- Effect: DB +4 OB +3 (agg) +4 DB, +2 OB, +1 PB(wimpy)
- Loads: Dol Guldur Drake
- You can wear ornate in one hand and staff with agate held as shield
  for this effect, you don't need to smiting with the staff

##### Rubellite

- Effect: +11 max mana
- Loads: Under tombstone near Hillside. To go there, give Brolg's
  standard to Erestor.
- Breaux: Adds 5% faster mana regen due to higher mana pool. Mana ring
  has 16% increased mana regen. Rubellite is way better than +attack
  major gem unless you blind/sleep a lot.(Source:
  <http://www.elvenrunes.de/cgi-bin/logs/secure/show.m?log=b65125,62169&disc=1&sort=1&snew=1&omode=&all=4&typ=#new>)
- Squaretooth wristband and rubellite stack: Wristband adds max 10 mana
  and rubellite adds another 11 mana
  - Archaic copper wristband 45 Magic, Anti-evil, Anti-neutral, +10 mana
    (+5 mana with shining mail, +0 mana shining plate)
  - Tarnished copper wristband 45 Magic, Anti-good, Anti-neutral, +10
    mana (+5 mana with shining mail, +0 mana shining plate)

##### Opal

- Effect: +10 attack spell(attack spell not only increases damage but
  also decreases backfire rate, so very good for BNs who suffer
  depression on spell backfires)
- Loads: sold in jewellers shop, in chest at statues in Woodhall, in
  Eregion, ancient warg near Khuzur (butcher corpse to get), on the
  crooked, long-armed creature in southeastern Lorien, Amon Othar,
  Shaghosh, Bulag

##### Corberyl

- Effect: +10 attack spell(attack spell not only increases damage but
  also decreases backfire rate, so very good for BNs who suffer
  depression on spell backfires)
- Loads: Muranog, Scaly beast (butcher corpse to get, extremely rare)

##### Chunk of honey-coloured amber

- Effect: Negates and absorb(as mana) single target spell damage. Amber
  gem produces a golden shield to absorb spell damage. You also get a
  mana boost equivalent to the normal cost of the attack spell used. The
  cool down time varies on how powerful the attack spell is, measured
  6min for burning hands, 8 min for lightning bolt and 10min for
  fireball.(from Ena)
- Loads: WHERE???

##### Tiger's Eye

- Effect: Hit/Mana regen: Elf,Half-Elf: +2/+1; Man,Dwarf: +1/+2; Hobbit
  +0/+3. +2 mana regen means ~8% faster mana regen.
- Loads: White tower quest(ringleader near GH), Sage's reward to darkies

### Minor(from best to worst subjectively)

##### Onyx (usable)

- Effect: using the staff/helmet on target drains 25-30 mana for 10 mana
- Loads: Vile Fetish, WHERE ELSE???
- Fieldy: Sometimes it was a little more than 30 mana. The cooldown
  period is short(~1min), but to get the same effect of draining 30 mana
  the onyx needs to recharge fully. Full recharge atleast 20min.

##### Citrine

- Effect: lowers mana-cost for locating-spells: locate, locate life and
  locate magic
- Loads: WHERE???

##### Polished white quartzite (usable)

- Effect: group-bless
- Loads: White tower quest(ringleader near GH)

##### Star sapphire

- Effect: -10 spell save
- Loads: GC, Scaly(very rare), Frychra husk(rare)

##### Pitch black spinel (usable)

- Effect: Group-shroud
- Loads: Drake quest DG

##### Small, green stone\[beryl\] (usable)

- Effect: Create food
- Loads: WHERE???

### Metals

- You only get the OB bonus if staff is worn as a smiting weapon
- Chunk of metal: +5OB +5PB 4lb
- Huge silvery bracer: +5OB +5PB 4lb
- Bar of iron: +5OB +5PB 7lb

## Cool combo setup by Jaagern

- Ancient Jewelled Helmet with Agate (helmet also reduces manacost)
- Unfocused staff with Agate+Chunk+HSB
- This way you have open ring slot for manaring/ruby ring
- But you can't bash

<!-- -->

- So in total Jaagern gets:
  - Helmet: Agate 4DB 3OB(aggressive)
  - Staff: Agate 4DB 3OB(aggressive) + 5PB chunk+ 5PB HSB
  - Manaring ( or switch to ruby ring or copper)
    - Total 8DB 6OB 10 PB and lower cost of spells but you can't bash
      and have possibility to switch to ruby ring/copper

<!-- -->

- Let's compare that to DB focus with Beje:
  - Beje: 30PB Saving spell -10
  - DB sapphire: 10DB
  - And you can bash
    - Total: 10DB 30PB Saving spell -10 but can bash. You can also wear
      better helmet: Silver morion/Dragonhelm. You can also wear ancient
      dwarven shield, probably losing couple DB, gaining +5PB.
    - Weight is same, Beje is 20lbs, staff is 12lbs+chunk 4lbs+HBS 4lbs
