title: "Learn"
---

It is possible to learn a skill from another player if:

- The student has no knowledge in the skill.
- Both student and teacher are of the same race.
- The teacher's knowledge is high enough.

You may only teach someone to a certain level of your own % knowledge in
a given skill. The knowledge gained by learning a skill in this manner
is governed by the same rules as practising in a guild and costs the
same number of practice sessions.

To teach a skill, type "teach <skill>" To stop teaching, hit <return>

To learn a skill type "learn <skill>" when someone is teaching it.
