It is possible to **learn** a [skill](skill "wikilink") from another
player if:

- The student has no knowledge in the skill.
- Both student and teacher are of the same race.
- The teacher's knowledge is high enough.

You may only teach someone to a certain level of your own % knowledge in
a given skill. The knowledge gained by learning a skill in this manner
is governed by the same rules as [practising](practice "wikilink") in a
[guild](guild "wikilink") and costs the same number of practice
sessions.

To teach a skill, type 'teach <skill>'

To stop teaching, hit <return>

To learn a skill type 'learn <skill>' when someone is teaching it.
