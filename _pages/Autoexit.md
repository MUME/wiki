\[Toggle Command\]

To allow you to automatically see the visible exits, you may enter
autoexit mode by typing 'autoexit'. It will display the list of the
visible exit directions upon entering the room.

Exits can be surrounded by a number of symbols (in order of precedence):
<nowiki>g

- dir\* - the room is sunlit - Orcs and Trolls only.

^dir^ - the room is outdoors - Trolls only. \[dir\] - a visible, closed
door blocks the way in this direction.

# dir

\- the room is a major road (IF you're on a major road already).

<dir>

\- there is a magical portal in the direction. (dir) - there is an open
door in that direction (note: if the door is broken, it won't be shown
as door)

</pre>

Two different kinds of brackets can be combined, e.g., =(dir)= is a road
leading through an open door (gate?).

The autoexit command can also be typed to toggle off the mode.

Example:

` > autoexit`
