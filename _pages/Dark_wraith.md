\> **look wraith**

The shape seems to shift and coalesce in the murky light, but a vague
humanoid outline can be gleaned. Tattered rags hang from the
creature's
body, seeming to almost float about its ethereal body. The only
noticeable
feature of this wraith is the gaze of its bloodshot, lidless eyes.
