Policy for Rerolls:

Since players get to choose their own stats, full rerolls are not given.

However, if you retire for a while, you will be able to obtain a limited
reroll by typing 'reroll' before leaving the halls of retirement. In
limited rerolls, you can change a few of your stats by a little - but
not to make drastic changes, like turning a spellcaster into a warrior.

Legends who retired before February 1, 2004 and non-legend characters
can reroll after 30 days in retirement. Legend characters who retired on
or after February 1, 2004, can reroll after a RL year in retirement.

Note that if you change your stats, your age will probably change as
well, since start age is a function of your stats, and your actual age
is calculated as birth age + delta, where the delta is kept constant
when you reroll.

Rerolling will automatically give you a reset of practices as well.
