Syntax: 'drag corpse'

You will start dragging the [Corpse](Corpse "wikilink"). If you move,
you pull the corpse with you. You will spend more movement points doing
this, of course. To stop dragging it, type 'drag' without any arguments.
It takes some time from when you move until the corpse is fully pulled
into the room, and if you move again before this happens, you stop
dragging. Some objects may be dragged too.
