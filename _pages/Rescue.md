Command\]

A **rescue** is an attempt to make an enemy or enemies hit you instead
of the person being rescued. This is highly usable when playing in
[groups](group "wikilink").

The chance to succeed depends on how high your rescue skill is. Typing
rescue with no argument rescues the character that is
[buffering](buffer "wikilink"). The skill also controls how well you can
[protect](protect "wikilink") people.

NOTE: The rescued person will experience some dizzyness. Learning the
[escape](escape "wikilink") skill has beneficial effects on the rescued
person.

Example:

`  > rescue morwen`
