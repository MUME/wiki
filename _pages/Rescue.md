## Rescue

(Warrior Skill) \[Instant Command\]

A rescue is an attempt to make an enemy or enemies hit you instead of
the person being rescued. This is highly usable when playing in groups.

The chance to succeed depends on the how high you know the rescue skill.
Typing rescue with no argument rescues the character that is buffering.
The skill also controls how well you can protect people.

NOTE: The rescued person will experience some dizzyness. Learning the
escape skill has beneficial effects on the rescued person.

Example:

`  > rescue morwen`
