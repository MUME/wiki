title: "Abandon"
---

If you are leading a mount, this command will make it stop following
you. The mount will remember its previous rider, so you can resume
leading it by typing "lead". If you abandon your mount but remain in the
room with it, others will not be able to lead it away. They can,
however, ride the mount and then control it out of the room.
