This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

Then Aragorn laid his hands on Merry's head, and passing his hand gently
through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by his
name. And when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room, like the
scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly
Merry awoke, and he said:

`  'I am hungry. What is the time?' " `

Merry, JRRT, The Return of the King
