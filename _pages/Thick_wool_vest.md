\> **look vest**
The garment you have acquired is made of thick scratchy wool. Soft and
of
fine quality, the sweater looks perfect for use in inclement weather.
You
assume that the thickness of the fabric will not affect your mobility,
and
will keep you warm and dry. The lands of Cardolan are heavy in sheep
populations, and the people make a living exporting the wool from
them.
Perhaps that is where the sweater came from.
\> **consider vest**
