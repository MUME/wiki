This setting affects how display from the "view" command is done.

By selecting "simple", such paging is done using the normal MUME pager.

By selecting "mume", such text is sent using the remote editing protocol
to your client (provided that your client supports this). If you, e.g.,
have powwow, this uses the setting in the POWWOWPAGER environment
variable.
