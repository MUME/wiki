The origin of the first black Númenóreans is in the latter half of the
Second Age. Lovers of power over lesser men, these Númenóreans became
corrupted by Sauron, coming to hate all good peoples. They settled in
Middle Earth mainly in Umbar and surrounding coastal regions. After
Sauron's downfall at the beginning of the Third Age, the bloodlines of
these Númenórean descendants mixed with other peoples, especially the
Haradrim over which they had dominion. During the first millenia of the
age, they proved strong enemies of the Dúnedain of Gondor, but were
permanently scattered when Umbar was taken in TA 933, and when the
subsequent siege was broken in TA 1050. As men, they are imposing in
their height, with angular features. They also make strong warriors,
proud of their heritage. Thus they still retain many of the ancient
characteristics of the Edain, like their cousins the Dúnedain.

## MUME BN'S

Mume Black Númenóreans are wanderers from the far southern lands. They
are allied with orcs and trolls who directly or indirectly serve the
will of Sauron.

BN's have a number of penalties:

- They can't become immortal.
- They generally have worse stats than other men.
- They have no cities in which to rent. However, they can camp outside
  and often do not pay rent.
- They must wander in search of those guildmasters of theirs who have
  made the trip to Eriador. No warrior guildmasters have ever been
  found, so their weapon skills are limited.
- When they die they return to a secret place and pray for a new life.
  Where they find themselves afterwards, only the Ainur know.
- They can suffer from depression.
- A BN will see free peoples by name or race only eg. \*an Elf\*. They
  can however see and group both orcs and trolls, thus proving to be
  valuable aides.
