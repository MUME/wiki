\> Some thick writhing vines whip all around you.
\> **look vines**
Thick brown vines move in a twisting motion. A large number of them lash
out
in different directions, as if they were trying to grab an
unsuspecting
traveller and slowly drain whatever life rests in him. The vines are
quite
sturdy and it would take a serious effort to break them.
