<nowiki>g Syntax : cast 'locate' \[<key>\] \[<max distance>\] Type :
Long range Accumulative: N/A Duration : No Casting : Very long Position
: Standing Level : Level 6 Class : Magic User Min. Mana : 20

</pre>

NOTE: <max distance> is given in miles.

NOTE: In order to use this spell you must first find out the magical key
of the object, mobile, or room you are attempting to locate. (In the
example the magical key is the "zordurhozo" part).

The keys for objects, mobiles, and players can be obtained with the
IDENTIFY spell.

NOTE: If you cast the LOCATE spell with no arguments, you will get the
magical key of the room you stand in. This key is needed when using the
TELEPORT, PORTAL, SCRY and WATCH ROOM spells.

A comparison between 'LOCATE LIFE' and 'LOCATE' (for locating mobiles):

LOCATE LIFE: needs: name of creature gives: nearby locations of the
creature, and their teleport keys

LOCATE: needs: magical key of creature gives: graphical representation
of those locations in relation to you (but no detailed information or
teleport keys)

Example: <nowiki>g

` > cast 'locate' zordurhozo`
