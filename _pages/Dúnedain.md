The **Dúnedain** are descenants of the Númenóreans who settled
[Middle-Earth](Middle-Earth "wikilink") in the Second Age. After the
sundering of Númenór they formed the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor.

They are now somewhat intermingled with the Eriadoran peoples, but still
possess great stature and long life.

Dúnedain enclaves in Eriador are few now, and only Fornost is of note.
Many wander the wilderness protecting the good people of Middle-Earth,
and are called [Rangers](Ranger "wikilink"). {% include ClassRace.md %}
