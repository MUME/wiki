Your whois must NOT emulate any game output, or in any other way act as
something that may affect gameplay. (For example, a
[whois](whois "wikilink") which says "*\*an Orc\* begins strange
incantations...*" would be illegal, as would be a whois which tricks a
[client](client "wikilink") into doing something, redraws the screen or
changes the terminal settings.)

Your [whois](whois "wikilink") is NOT a form of communication and should
therefore not be used to pass information on should you get slept,
silenced, killed, etc.

All whoises are subject to veto by some of the higher gods. If one of
these asks you to change your whois, for whatever reason, you should
comply or risk bansite or temporary suspension of your character. All
whoises must be in English or any of the languages used in Middle Earth.
