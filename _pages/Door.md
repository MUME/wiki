You can **open**, **close**, **lock**, or **unlock** (if you have an
appropriate [key](key "wikilink")) a **door** or a
[container](container "wikilink").

You can open, close, lock, or unlock the door [exits](exit "wikilink")
of the [room](room "wikilink") by the exact name of the exit (e.g. \>
open gate), or by giving the [direction](direction "wikilink") of the
exit (e.g. \> open exit s). Secret exits have to be addressed by their
exact name. Non-hidden exits can be addressed as simply 'exit'.

`'> open stone' or '> open stone south' [or just 'open stone s']`
`'> open chest' or '> open 2.chest'`

(if there's more than one to choose from)

Note that latched doors can be locked and unlocked without a key.
