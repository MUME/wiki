title: "Race"
---

There are nine different races you can play on MUME.

Five of these belong to the good side (a.k.a. "whities"). They are Men,
Elves, Half-elves, Hobbits, and Dwarves. There are also Bears, which are
not a separate race but shapechanged Beorning Men.

Three are the evil races (a.k.a. "darkies"); they are Tarkhnarb Orcs,
Trolls, and Black Númenoreans.

The last race is the Zaugurz Orcs, forming a side of its own.

Different races have different effects on their basic statistics, as you
can see in the table below.

Age is how slow members of this race age compared to Men. I.e., an Elf
ages 3 times slower, and a Hobbit 1.5 times slower.

Other than these, there are effects on height and weight and a variety
of other areas.
