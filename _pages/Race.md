Ring](The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring_(film) "wikilink")*\]\]
There are nine different **races** you can play on MUME.

Five of these belong to the good side (a.k.a. "whities"). They are Men,
Elves, Half-elves, Hobbits, and Dwarves. There are also Bears, which are
not a separate race but shapechanged Beorning Men.

Three are the evil races (a.k.a. "darkies"); they are Tarkhnarb Orcs,
Trolls, and Black Númenóreans.

The last race is the Zaugurz Orcs, forming a side of its own. { \|
