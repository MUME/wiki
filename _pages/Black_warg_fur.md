\> **look fur**
This dark fur is composed of black hairs which, when observed closely,
are
somewhat reflective against the light. It is not very heavy, but the
skin
is surprisingly tough. It is slightly warm to the touch, as though
imbued
with its original owner's strength.
\> **consider fur**
It is a black warg fur.
It weighs eight pounds.

## Opinions

Probably the most commonly used [OB](offensive_bonus "wikilink") item,
it is light compared to a [cave bear fur](cave_bear_fur "wikilink") and
can be easily switched for a cloak when defence is necessary.
