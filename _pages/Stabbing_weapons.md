## Stabbing Weapons

(Warrior Skill) (Weapon Class)

The stabbing weapons skill applies to all spears and polearms, if they
are wielded in one hand only. These weapons are particularly effective
against riding enemies.

If you are wielding a stabbing weapon, you are ready to fight, and an
enemy tries to attack you with a shorter weapon, you will automatically
try to hit the enemy before being hit. If this attempt succeeds, you
have a chance of keeping the enemy at bay - the enemy automatically
fails his first attack. The chance of this happening depends on your
reach and the opponent's reach: a Troll is much harder to keep at bay
than a Hobbit.
