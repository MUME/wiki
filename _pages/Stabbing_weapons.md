The **stabbing weapons** [skill](skill "wikilink") is a
[warrior](warrior "wikilink") skill and [weapon](weapon "wikilink")
class that applies to all spears and polearms, if they are wielded in
one hand only. These weapons are particularly effective against
[riding](ride "wikilink") enemies.

If you are wielding a [stabbing weapon](stabbing_weapon "wikilink"), you
are ready to fight, and an enemy tries to attack you with a shorter
weapon, you will automatically try to hit the enemy before being hit. If
this attempt succeeds, you have a chance of keeping the enemy at bay -
the enemy automatically fails his first attack. The chance of this
happening depends on your reach and the opponent's reach: a
[Troll](Troll "wikilink") is much harder to keep at bay than a
[Hobbit](Hobbit "wikilink").
