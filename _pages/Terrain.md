title: Terrain
---

Each place on [Arda](Arda "wikilink") is characterized by a specific
**terrain** type, which is represented (in prompts and elsewhere) as
follows:

\[ - Indoors \< - Mountains + - Road \# - City % - Shallow water : -
Brush . - Field ~ - Water = - Tunnel f - Forest W - Rapids O - Cavern
( - Hills U - Underwater

At the moment, the symbols used in 'map' and 'map global' are different,
due to historical reasons...

Different [races](race "wikilink") find it easier or harder to move in
different terrains. The 'easier' and 'harder' below refer to the Human
norm. \| Field Forest Hill Swamp Mountain
-------+---------------------------------------- Elves \| . easier . .
