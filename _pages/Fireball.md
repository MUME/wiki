title: "Fireball"

**Fireball** is a mid-level [mage](mage "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"), castable on characters and special
[mudlled](mudlle "wikilink") objects. As its name implies it lets loose
a fireball hurled at the target, enveloping it in flames, causing severe
damage. It is of medium speed, uses a minor amount of
[mana](mana "wikilink"), causes much damage, and it is
[storable](store "wikilink"), all this makes it a common spell in both
[player killing](player_killing "wikilink") and against
[mobiles](mobile "wikilink"). [Legend](Legend "wikilink") mages can
usually store 2 fireballs.

Both good races and [Black Númenoreans](Black_Númenorean "wikilink") can
learn this spell, but not [orcs](orc "wikilink").
