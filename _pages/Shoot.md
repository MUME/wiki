**Shoot** is the [command](command "wikilink") used to fire a [missile
weapon](missile_weapon "wikilink"). If you are
[fighting](combat "wikilink") someone already, you can fire an arrow by
typing just 'shoot', if you are not already engaged, you can start or
join a fight by typing 'shoot <victim>'.

From time to time, nonmagical [missiles](ammunition "wikilink") will
break. This is likely to happen if you shoot a hard-to-hit target, or
when your shot kills the opponent.
