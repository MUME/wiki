title: "Shoot"
---

'SHOOT' is the command used to fire a missile weapon. If you are
fighting someone already, you can fire an arrow by typing just 'SHOOT',
if you are not already engaged, you can start or join a fight by typing
SHOOT <victim>.

From time to time, nonmagical missiles will break. This is likely to
happen if you shoot a hard-to-hit target, or when your shot kills the
opponent.
