[Fornost](Fornost "wikilink"). The [Black Dagger
Guild](Black_Dagger_Guild "wikilink") is hidden in the cellar of a
ruined building in the northern part of this zone, and various criminals
lurk about and prey upon unsuspecting travellers. The ruins to the south
are inhabited by all kinds of malignant undead.
