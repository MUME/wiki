\> **look helmet**
This conical leather helmet is joined together with two strips of
stiff
cowhide, and fastened with four rather dull metal studs. The rim fits
rather
low on your head, just above your eyebrows.
\> **consider helmet**
It is a sturdy leather helmet (satisfactory, new).
It weighs a couple of pounds.
