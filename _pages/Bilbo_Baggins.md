Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit who lived in The Shire during the final years
of the Third Age. His adventure with the dwarves Thorin and company
earned him a fortune, and brought the One Ring of Sauron back into
knowledge. Bilbo was noteworthy as the first ring-bearer in the history
of Middle-earth to give up the One Ring voluntarily; he surrendered the
ring to Frodo Baggins at Gandalf's request.
