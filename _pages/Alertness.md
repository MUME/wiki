title: Alertness
---

Via the 'change alertness' command, you can decide how much attention
you will pay to the presence of hidden people. High alertness levels
will improve your chance of detecting sneakers and backstabbers, at the
cost of significantly slowing down your regeneration rate.

A high alertness setting will also improve your peripheral vision when
you are involved in a thick melee.
