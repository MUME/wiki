When you attack someone else, or are attacked by someone else, or you
try to [steal](steal "wikilink") something, your ability to
[quit](quit "wikilink") the game or [rent](rent "wikilink") in an inn is
suspended for a certain amount of time: about two minutes if you fought
a mobile, more if you were involved in pkilling.

If your [link](link "wikilink") drops while you are affected by noquit,
other players will still be able to damage you while noquit lasts;
moreover, if you are a [Troll](Troll "wikilink") and lose link while you
have noquit, you are vulnerable to [sundeath](sundeath "wikilink").
