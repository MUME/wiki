title: "Consider"

Syntax: consider \<mobile \| player \| object\>

This command will compare your Level with the \<mobile \| player\>
level. You will then receive a rough estimate, which is by no means
exact. Consider does not take hit points/special attacks/damage into
account.

If used on an object, you will be told an estimate of its weight, and
possibly some other information.

Example: \> consider sauron You ARE mad!
