\> **look food**

A mushroom lies here, pale brown in colour. On its cap there are

white patches of skin that are loosely attached. It looks safe to eat,

and seems to glow faintly.

\> **consider food**

It is a magic mushroom.

It weighs about one pound.

## Information

A magic mushroom appears out of nowhere when you cast the spell [Create
Food](Create_Food "wikilink"), usually one magic mushroom is enough to
make you satisfied but at lower levels or when not practised enough you
need two to get full.
