title: "Novoid"
---

MUME characters have linkless protection: if your link drops, you soon
become invulnerable until you reconnect. However, this feature is
sometimes abused by players deliberately dropping link to avoid death.

The NOVOID flag prevents this, by removing your linkless protection
against other players if you have recently met (or seen, or scried, or
heard...) a member of an enemy race.

While you have novoid, you can [rent](rent "wikilink") at an
[inn](inn "wikilink") normally: it only affects your vulnerability while
you're linkless.

Of course, if you are already linkless, you cannot gain a novoid flag.
