title: "Reveal"
---

Syntax: reveal <object>, reveal <character>, reveal all or reveal
<effort>

Reveal <object> allows you to find an object you've hidden in a room.
You must know what to look for in order to get it back, but you can dig
up someone else's treasure if you wish.

Reveal <character> shows to your group members the location of a hidden
character you discovered (with "search" or because the hidden character
spoke when you could hear him). Characters not in your group might
realize the presence of the hidden character as well.

Revealing a hostile character allows your group members to attack him;
on the other hand, if you attack without revealing, you have a higher
chance of taking your enemy by surprise when he is not ready to defend
himself.

"Reveal all" works as "reveal <character>", but it affects any and all
hidden characters that you have discovered.

Reveal <effort>" (quickly, fast, normally, carefully or thoroughly) is
similar to "search <effort>", but it will reveal any hidden character
you might find. If more than one character is searching at the same
time, "reveal" is faster than "search", but it decreases the chances of
a surprise attack.

Examples: <nowiki>g

` > reveal boots`
` > reveal scout`
` > reveal quickly`
