## Sneak

(Thief Skill)

Usage: sneak \[on\|off\]

Used for sneaking (moving in and out of rooms without anyone knowing).
The sneak command will toggle on and off your ability to sneak.

The chances of a succesful sneak depend on the terrain and the number of
people you are trying to hide from. You must be on foot: sneaking on
horseback is impossible. It is impossible to sneak successfully when you
are fleeing a room. Hobbits (and Elves to a lesser extent) sneak well,
Dwarves not so well, and Trolls are totally inept at sneaking.

After sneaking successfully, you are hidden from the people in the room,
but if they look for you they will find you instantly.

You move slower when sneaking.

Examples:

`  > sneak`
`  Ok, you'll try to move silently for a while.`
`  S > sneak`
`  You stop sneaking.`
`  >`
