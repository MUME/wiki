Usage: sneak \[on\|off\]

**Sneak** is a [thief](thief "wikilink") [skill](skill "wikilink") used
for moving in and out of [rooms](room "wikilink") without anyone
knowing. The sneak command will toggle on and off your ability to sneak.

The chances of a succesful sneak depend on the terrain and the number of
people you are trying to hide from. You must be on foot: sneaking on
[horseback](ride "wikilink") is impossible. It is impossible to sneak
successfully when you are [fleeing](flee "wikilink") a room.
[Hobbits](Hobbit "wikilink") (and [Elves](elf "wikilink") to a lesser
extent) sneak well, [Dwarves](dwarf "wikilink") not so well, and
[Trolls](Troll "wikilink") are totally inept at sneaking.

After sneaking successfully, you are [hidden](hide "wikilink") from the
people in the room, but if they look for you they will find you
instantly.

You move slower when sneaking.

Examples:

`  > sneak`
`  Ok, you'll try to move silently for a while.`
`  S > sneak`
`  You stop sneaking.`
`  >`
