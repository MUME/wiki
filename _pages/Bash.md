## Bash

(Warrior Skill) \[Delayed Command\]

The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned, as well as
on your offensive bonus and the victim's defence. To bash someone is to
attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you succeed you will inflict
minor damage and cause the victim to fall on the rear. The victim will
be unable to issue any commands or do damage in combat for a short
period of time; he will, however, be able to parry or dodge hits. If you
miss, you lose your balance and fall.

Note that a person bashed is sitting and has less dodge. This will only
apply to the first hit the bashed person receives.

It is possible to bash either with a shield or with a two handed weapon,
or with your hands if you are a Troll or a Bear.

If you have high strength, bash can also be used to break down some
doors. Unlike for bashing an opponent, in this case your current mood
has no influence on your chance of success.

An option is to 'bash disengage <name>'. If successful, the victim stops
fighting and just sits on the ground for a short period of time.

NOTE: You can bash any enemy that is engaged to you. This will not cause
you to switch target as kill or hit would.

Examples:

`  > bash bear`
`  > bash door`
`  > bash dis elf`
