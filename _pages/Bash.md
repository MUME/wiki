title: Bash
---

**Bash** is a [warrior](warrior "wikilink") [skill](skill "wikilink")
that allows you to knock an opponent over. The success of a bash depends
upon how well you are learned, as well as on your offensive bonus and
the victim's defence. If you succeed you will inflict minor damage and
cause the victim to fall on the rear. The victim will be unable to issue
any [commands](command "wikilink") or do damage in combat for a short
period of time; he will, however, be able to [parry](parry "wikilink")
or [dodge](dodge "wikilink") hits. If you miss, you lose your balance
and fall.

Note that a person bashed is [sitting](sit "wikilink") and has less
dodge. This will only apply to the first hit the bashed person receives.

It is possible to bash either with a shield or with a two handed weapon,
or with your hands if you are a [Troll](Troll "wikilink") or a
[Bear](Bear "wikilink").

If you have high strength, bash can also be used to break down some
[doors](door "wikilink"). Unlike for bashing an opponent, in this case
your current mood has no influence on your chance of success.

An option is to 'bash disengage <name>'. If successful, the victim stops
fighting and just sits on the ground for a short period of time.

NOTE: You can bash any enemy that is engaged to you. This will not cause
you to switch target as [kill](kill "wikilink") or [hit](hit "wikilink")
would.

Examples:

`  > bash bear`
`  > bash door`
`  > bash dis elf`
