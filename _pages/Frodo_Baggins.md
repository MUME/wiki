Frodo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Third Age, the most famous of all
Hobbits in the histories for his leading role in the Quest of the Ring.
During this epic quest, he bore the One Ring to Mount Doom and there
destroyed it, giving him renown like no other Halfling throughout
Middle-earth. He is also peculiar for being, as a Ring-bearer, one of
the three Hobbits who sailed from Middle-earth to Aman, there to die in
peace.
