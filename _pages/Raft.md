title: "Raft"

**Rafts** are a common type of [boat](boat "wikilink"), often found near
[waterways](waterways "wikilink"). They can also be bought from
[Captains](Captain "wikilink") for around 5 [silver](gold "wikilink").
Their heavy weight makes them somewhat cumbersome to carry around,
meaning other boats such as [canoes](canoe "wikilink") are generally
preferable options.
