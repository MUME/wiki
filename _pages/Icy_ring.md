title: "Icy ring"

## Statistics

!# CW\>**examine icy**
The ring, covered by a thinning layer of ice, is made of a silvery metal
and
elegantly engraved. While many of the details of the engraving are not
distinguishable beneath the ice, a faint picture of an elven warrior
bowing
before his king is visible. The ice still consists of several layers
all
uniformly covering the ring, except the top layer which shows some
irregular
signs of melting.<sup>\*</sup>

!# CW\>**consider icy**
It is an icy ring.
It radiates a magical aura.
It weighs a couple of ounces.

## Opinions

Although somewhat difficult to attain, icy rings are not terribly
powerful and certainly not of vital importance to any character. It is
said they give the wearer some protection against (some) fire, though
the actual protection benefits are somewhat limited, making this a
mostly 'nifty to have' item, rather than an essential.

<sup>\*</sup><small>This last sentence of the description indicates the
'damage' the ring has taken, the line in this particular description
shows that the ring in question has taken the first step down to
dissolving - much like weapons and armour go from flawless to
well-maintained.
