Usage: METAMORPH <ANIMAL> RETURN \[to return to real form\]

Upon becoming a [hero](hero "wikilink") (level 21+) characters gain the
ability to choose to take the Istar Quest, and seek immortality. The
first step of this involves the apprentice levels known as metamorph
levels. At the levels of shapechanger (21) and metamorph (22), the
character can only gain experience while in the form of an animal. The
animals which the player may become are dependent on both his level and
his alignment. For example, a good player of level 22 can metamorph into
an eagle.

Each meta form has unique advantages and disadvantages over the others,
and the meta form does not retain any of the skills of the character in
his normal form, nor do spells cast upon the normal form carry over to
the metamorph. Metamorphs are also unable to bash doors.

Note, that in order for any experience or travel points gained while in
metamorph form to be saved, you must return to your normal form.
However, any gold or equipment carried by the meta form will be lost
upon return. Metas have no autowimpy mode, but can flee manually if they
choose.

[Beornings](Beorning "wikilink") can also metamorph into a
[Bear](Bear "wikilink").
