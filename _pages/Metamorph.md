Usage: **metamorph** <animal>

**return** \[to return to real form\]

Upon becoming a [hero](hero "wikilink") ([level](level "wikilink") 21+)
characters gain the ability to choose to take the
[Istar](Istar "wikilink") Quest, and seek immortality. The first step of
this involves the apprentice levels known as metamorph levels. At the
levels of shapechanger (21) and metamorph (22), the character can only
gain [experience](experience "wikilink") while in the form of an animal.
The animals which the player may become are dependent on both his level
and his [alignment](alignment "wikilink"). For example, a good player of
level 22 can metamorph into an eagle.

Each meta form has unique advantages and disadvantages over the others,
and the meta form does not retain any of the [skills](skill "wikilink")
of the character in his normal form, nor do [spells](spell "wikilink")
cast upon the normal form carry over to the metamorph. Metamorphs are
also unable to [bash](bash "wikilink") doors.

Note, that in order for any experience or [travel
points](travel_points "wikilink") gained while in metamorph form to be
saved, you must return to your normal form. However, any
[gold](gold "wikilink") or [equipment](equipment "wikilink") carried by
the meta form will be lost upon return. Metas have no autowimpy mode,
but can [flee](flee "wikilink") manually if they choose.

[Beornings](Beorning "wikilink") can also metamorph into a Bear.
