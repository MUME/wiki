When creating your legend home you will be able to decide certain
things, one of which is the style and complexity of the door to it. You
can have most any type of material to make your door out of, much like
the rest of Arda. Branches, wood and metal are the most common. Keep in
mind the area you locate your house in, your door will need to match the
existing surroundings to be approved.

You may elect to pay for upgrades to the pickable percentage of the door
lock as well. There are no upkeep charges per day when upgrading your
door. The higher % your door has, the higher the % of the person trying
to pick the door open will need to be. Each increment of 10% is 200 gold
coins:

  Pick %          Total Price -------------------------------    10%
               200g    20%                400g    30%
               600g    40%                800g    50%
               1000g    60%                1200g    70%
               1400g    80%                1600g    90%
               1800g    100%               2000g \* Keep in mind that
100% isn't necessarily unpickable. \* You may no longer buy nobash,
nobreak or nopick for your door.

You may hire a doorman who will faithfully stand inside your home to
open and close the door upon your command for an additional 750 gold and
5 silver per day upkeep.
