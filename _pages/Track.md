**Track** is a [ranger](general "wikilink") skill that enables you to
follow the tracks of people and animals and to determine their location
at a distance.

To use this skill, use either the track command or the
[where](where "wikilink") command.

The command 'track', issued by itself, will examine the tracks in your
location and (after a delay) tell you who and what has passed by. A
particular set of tracks will be more or less visible depending on what
made it, how long ago, what the weather is, and the terrain. If you are
unlucky, you will see fewer tracks - you might see more if you 'track'
again.

Issuing the command 'track <target>' looks for the most recent tracks of
the specific person/thing you are looking for. Furthermore, if you
follow the tracks, you will automatically keep on tracking your target
until you find it, or lose the trail, or issue the 'track' command
again. To stop following the trail, issue the 'track' command without
arguments.

Typing 'where <target>' also looks for tracks of target in the room you
are currently in, but you will not keep looking for tracks as you move
around.

Some creatures, such as fish, birds, and spirits, will not leave tracks.

In addition to the ability to follow the tracks of other creatures,
people who are skilled at tracking may be better able to find their way
through terrain which would confuse a less skilled person. This will not
be the case if the light is bad, however.

Being a more skilled tracker will not only make it possible for you to
find well-covered tracks, but you will also track faster. Be aware that
there is a limit to how fast you can actually track somebody though.
Examples: \> track \> track warg \> where robber

Certain [mobiles](mobile "wikilink") are also capable of tracking
(including, but not limited to, most wolves and
[wargs](warg "wikilink")), and will attempt to track you down if you've
[fled](flee "wikilink") from combat with them. Some mobiles will only
track in a very limited area near their spawn location, while others may
follow you for larger distances.
