If you find a track using the command '[track](track "wikilink")'
<target>, you have the option to follow these tracks with the command
**pursue**. 'Pursue' will cause you to follow the track in whichever
direction it leads. This is a faster and more convenient way to follow a
track over long distances.

Also note that 'pursue' will cause you to enter the
[room](room "wikilink") in question no matter what danger may lie in it.
You will need to enter the command each time you wish to pursue your
victim.

You can also 'pursue <target>'. This command has the same delay as
'track <target>' but will also move you when you find the track. It can
be used for initial tracking but is not advisable as a method of
following a track over longer distances.

Examples:

` > pursue`
` > pursue gwokk`

For following a track over several rooms:

` > track *dwarf*  OR  pursue *dwarf*`
` > pursue`
` > pursue`
