---

\> **look trousers**

The thigh and shin guards of these trousers-come-greaves have been
joined

together with strong hardened knee guards. It seems they will provide
the

wearer with decent protection, as well as perhaps shielding from the
elements.

\> **consider trousers**

They are a sturdy pair of hard leather trousers.

They weigh five pounds.
