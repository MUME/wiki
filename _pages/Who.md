Syntax: **who** \[<group>\] \[alphabetically\|number\]

Lists the people currently in the game (although some people may choose
to remain unseen).

Available groups: ainur dwarves heroes men pray stoor bears elf hill
metamorphs rangers tales beornings elves hobbits mortals retired
tarkhnarb black eriadorian istari mountain rohirrim testchars cave
fallohid legends newbies scouts thieves clerics females mages noldor
shamans trolls dúnadan half-elves magic-users númenóreans silvan valar
dúnedain halflings males orcs sindar warriors dwarf harfoot man players
songs zaugurz If you specify "number", you will not get the actual
listing, but just the total number of players (in that group).

If you specify "alphabetically" (or some abbreviation longer than "al"),
the players will be listed alphabetically. By default they are listed by
how long they have been logged in (longest last).

Members of enemy [races](races "wikilink") (for example
[Elves](Elves "wikilink") and [Trolls](Troll "wikilink")) are unable to
see each other with this command. Members of races who cooperate from
time to time ([Dwarves](Dwarves "wikilink") and
[Bears](Beorning "wikilink"), Trolls and Tarkhnarb
[Orcs](Orc "wikilink")) can only see each other if they belong to the
same group.
