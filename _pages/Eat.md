**Eat** (or **taste**) and **drink** (or **sip**) are the commands for
consuming food and drink, respectively. When you're hungry or thirsty,
you will find that you tire more quickly and regain [hit
points](hit_points "wikilink") and [mana](mana "wikilink") more slowly.

Examples:

` > Taste mushroom`
` > Eat loaf`
` > Drink skin`
` > Sip cup`
