The ignore command blocks the output of up to 20 other players. If you
ignore a player, you will not be able to see narrates, songs, shouts,
yells, tells, beeps or prays from that player or any mobiles that player
has charmed (or pets bought).

Syntax:

ignore <player> - toggles ignoring that player on/off ignore <player>
yes\|on - ignore player ignore <player> no\|off - stop ignoring a player
ignore - shows a list of players you are ignoring

NOTE: Players you ignore cannot tell that you are ignoring them.

The existence of this command cannot be used as an argument for
violations of rules regulating communication and spam. It is merely an
aid for people who wish to ignore up to 20 other characters.
