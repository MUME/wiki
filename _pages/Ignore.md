The **ignore** command blocks the output of up to 20 other players. If
you ignore a player, you will not be able to see
[narrates](narrate "wikilink"), songs, shouts, yells, tells,
[beeps](beep "wikilink") or [prays](pray "wikilink") from that player or
any [mobiles](mobile "wikilink") that player has
[charmed](charm "wikilink") (or pets bought).

Syntax:

`ignore `<player>`        - toggles ignoring that player on/off`
`ignore `<player>` yes|on - ignore player`
`ignore `<player>` no|off - stop ignoring a player`
`ignore                 - shows a list of players you are ignoring`

NOTE: Players you ignore cannot tell that you are ignoring them.

The existence of this command cannot be used as an argument for
violations of [rules](rules "wikilink") regulating communication and
spam. It is merely an aid for people who wish to ignore up to 20 other
characters.
