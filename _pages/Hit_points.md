**Hit points** (hps) is a way of representing how much physical damage
your character can endure before [dying](death "wikilink"). Being low on
hit points means that you character is closer to death than when he or
she is high on hit points.

By default, your current level of hit points is displayed in your
[prompt](prompt "wikilink"). If nothing is shown, it means your are not
wounded at all; otherwise, one of the following words is displayed (in
descending order of health): Fine \> Hurt \> Wounded \> Bad \> Awful.

It is not a good idea starting a fight at wounded or below.
