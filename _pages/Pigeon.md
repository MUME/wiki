If you wish to send a small item - usually a note - to someone else, you
can buy a trained pigeon in a pet shop. Give the item to the pigeon and
SEND it to the recipient. For instance: give note pigeon; send Bilbo.
The pigeon will return to its owner after completing his mission, or
when it can't find the recipient.

Note that occasionally pigeons may get lost and neither deliver the
item, nor come back to the owner.
