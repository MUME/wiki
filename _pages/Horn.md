\> **look horn**

It is a long, backwards curving horn with thick, transversal ridges.
Although

hollow, you feel that it's pretty resistant. Its point is also quite
sharp.

\> **consider horn**

This piercing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is awful while attacking and poor while defending; its speed is very
fast, and it inflicts little damage upon hitting.

It weighs three pounds.
