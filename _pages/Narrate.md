title: Narrate
---

If you want to tell a tale to all the other players in the game, narrate
it. All the players wanting to hear such things will receive it and all
the players who don't want to be disturbed won't. You can choose to
receive tales from other players using the command "LISTEN TALES".

The global communication channels are not that global, since they are
restricted to either players of the same race, or at least to players of
the same side of the war between Good and Evil.

NOTE: The effort you make when communicating with other players on a
global level takes it's toll. Narrating reduces your movement points.

The [Narrate](Narrate "wikilink") channel is meant primarily for in-game
communication. Discussions about music, movies, computers, sports, sex
or other RL related issues generally don't belong there. If you are
asked by other player(s) to take your discussion to the SONGS channel,
you are required to do so.

Example:

` > narrate Is it safe to travel from Bree to Fornost?`
