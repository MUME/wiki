title: Narrate

If you want to tell a tale to all the other players in the game,
**narrate** it. All the players wanting to hear such things will receive
it and all the players who don't want to be disturbed won't. You can
choose to receive tales from other players using the command 'listen
tales'.

The global communication channels are not that global, since they are
restricted to either players of the same race, or at least to players of
the same side of the war between Good and Evil.

NOTE: The effort you make when communicating with other players on a
global level takes it's toll. Narrating reduces your [movement
points](movement_points "wikilink").

The **Narrate** channel is meant primarily for in-game communication.
Discussions about music, movies, computers, sports, sex or other RL
related issues generally don't belong there.

If you are asked by other player(s) to take your discussion to the
[Songs](sing "wikilink") channel, you are required to do so.

Example:

` > narrate Is it safe to travel from `[`Bree`](Bree "wikilink")` to `[`Fornost`](Fornost "wikilink")`?`

See also: [Tell](Tell "wikilink"), [Yell](Yell "wikilink"),
[Shout](Shout "wikilink"), [Listen](Listen "wikilink"),
[Sing](Sing "wikilink"), [Ignore](Ignore "wikilink")
