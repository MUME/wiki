*This article is about the group of players. For the
[mobile](mobile "wikilink"), see [young ranger](young_ranger "wikilink")
or [hardened ranger](hardened_ranger "wikilink"). For the set of skills,
see [general](general "wikilink").*

**Rangers** are experienced players who willingly help new players out
with questions and other things. A Ranger (unlike
[Istari](Istari "wikilink")) has the right to deny a
[newbie](newbie "wikilink") help and can also be fully involved in the
[race](race "wikilink") wars. Rangers, however, are supposed to set a
good example among whitie heroes --- and will hence be severely punished
by Elbereth or the Valar if he or she misbehaves.

Since being a ranger is a prolonged volunteer service, rangers can --
unlike the Istari -- go incognito. This way they will not be shown under
'who ranger'.

To become a Ranger, contact any member of the management.
