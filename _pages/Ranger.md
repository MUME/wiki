*This article is about the group of players. For the set of skills, see
[general](general "wikilink").*

**Rangers** are heroes of the free people of Arda who willingly help new
players out with questions and other things. A Ranger (unlike
[Istari](Istari "wikilink")) has the right to deny a newbie help and can
also be fully involved in the [race](race "wikilink") wars. Rangers,
however, are supposed to set a good example among whitie heroes --- and
will hence be severely punished by Elbereth or the Valar if he or she
misbehaves.

Since being a ranger is a prolonged volunteer service, rangers can --
unlike the Istari -- go [incognito](incognito "wikilink"). This way they
will not be shown under 'who ranger'.

To become a Ranger, contact any member of the management - to do so,
just send a tell to some visible V+ or pray once in a while during
playing.

## Ranger mobs

There are also some mobiles in [MUME](MUME "wikilink") who bear the name
of ranger. **Young rangers** will guide new players (relatively) safely
from one [city](city "wikilink") to another. **Hardened rangers** patrol
the area west of Bree, hunting down minions of Sauron as well as evil
whities.
