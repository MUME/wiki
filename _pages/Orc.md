Also known as Goblins, these foul creatures were created by Morgoth in
the First Age. Through his evil power, it is said he corrupted the
beautiful Elves and transformed them into his servants of evil, the
Orcs. They delight in seeing things suffer and bear malice especially to
Elves and Dwarves. They are not intelligent and gain most of their
destructive power in their large clans. The evil force of Mordor has
drawn Orcs together to create a force along with His other servants
which is maybe too strong for the Elves and Men to vanquish.

## MUME Orcs

MUME Orcs are very strong, but other than that suffer considerably. Orcs
make powerful warriors, but have difficulties with other classes.

There are two tribes of Orcs in MUME; the Uruk-Tarkhnarb and the
Uruk-Zaugurz. The Tarkhnarb Orcs are subjects of Sauron, allies of the
Black Númenóreans and the powerful Trolls in the battle against the Free
People. The Zaugurz Orcs were cast out of Goblin Gate (the primary
dwelling of the Tarkhnarb), and are now at war with the Tarkhnarb and
their allies.

Orcs in MUME are treated differently from the other races:

- They may not become immortal.
- They generally have worse stats than the other races.
- Sunlight affects them badly (much lower bonuses, use movement points
  much faster, increased difficulty in spell casting).
- They have the ability to see in the dark without a light source.
