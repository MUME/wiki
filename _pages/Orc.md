![](Uruk-hai.jpg "Uruk-hai.jpg")''\]\] **Orcs**, also known as
**Goblins**, are foul creatures that were created by Morgoth in the
First Age. Through his evil power, it is said he corrupted the beautiful
[Elves](elf "wikilink") and transformed them into his servants of evil,
the Orcs. They delight in seeing things suffer and bear malice
especially to Elves and [Dwarves](dwarf "wikilink"). They are not
intelligent and gain most of their destructive power in their large
clans. The evil force of Mordor has drawn Orcs together to create a
force along with His other servants which is maybe too strong for the
Elves and [Men](man "wikilink") to vanquish.

## Orcs in [MUME](MUME "wikilink")

MUME Orcs are very strong, but other than that suffer considerably. Orcs
make powerful warriors, but have difficulties with other classes.

There are two playable tribes of Orcs in MUME; the
[Uruk-Tarkhnarb](Uruk-Tarkhnarb "wikilink") and the
[Uruk-Zaugurz](Uruk-Zaugurz "wikilink"). The Tarkhnarb Orcs are subjects
of Sauron, allies of the [Black
Númenoreans](Black_Númenorean "wikilink") and the powerful
[Trolls](Troll "wikilink") in the battle against the Free People. The
Zaugurz Orcs were cast out of Goblin Gate (the primary dwelling of the
Tarkhnarb), and are now at war with the Tarkhnarb and their allies.

Orcs in MUME are treated differently from the other races:

- They may not become immortal.
- They generally have worse stats than the other races.
- Sunlight affects them badly (much lower bonuses, use movement points
  much faster, increased difficulty in spell casting).
- They have the ability to see in the dark without a light source.

In addition to the playable orc tribes, there are many non-playable
tribes in MUME:

- [Uruk-Burzruth](Burzruth_Orc "wikilink") who live in the eastern half
  of the [Mines of Moria](Moria "wikilink")
- [Uruk-Durbûk](Durbûk_Orc "wikilink") who reside in the mountains of
  [Emyn-nu-Fuin](Mirkwood "wikilink")
- [Uruk-Durghash](Durghash_Orc "wikilink") who have taken over the
  western half of the [Mines of Moria](Moria "wikilink")
- [Uruk-Moragog](Moragog_Orc "wikilink") who live in the upper levels of
  eastern [Moria](Moria "wikilink")
- [Uruk-Morgundul](Morgundul_Orc "wikilink") that reside in Red Horn
  Pass, [Vales of Anduin](Anduin_Vale "wikilink"), and [Dol
  Guldur](Dol_Guldur "wikilink")
- [Uruk-Ohurk](Ohurk_Orc "wikilink") who have set up camp around the
  Ford of the River Bruinen
- [Uruk-Urughash](Urughash_Orc "wikilink") who live in the Misty
  Mountains bordering [Dunland](Dunland "wikilink")
