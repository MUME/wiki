The **mage** is a class of powerful and violent magic, however it does
not possess the same healing powers as a [cleric](cleric "wikilink").
Protective [spells](spell "wikilink") exist, which are quite effective
at absorbing and dodging enemy damage.

### Opinion

Mages are master damage dealers who can [teleport](teleport "wikilink"),
[charm animals](charm "wikilink"), and cast [area of effect
spells](earthquake "wikilink"). Being a caster, they are more difficult
to play than other classes.
