title: "Rules Mappers"

Please note that while mappers are legal to use on MUME, that does not
have to include all the features provided by a mapping-program!

Basically everything stated in [Rules Actions](Rules_Actions "wikilink")
is also true for mappers. As consequence, your mapper must not act as
action for you by setting aliases or perform other tasks without your
interference (in PK-situations). Management will make no difference
between an illegal action performed by a client or by a mapper!

The abuse and possible features of mappers are too many to list here,
but as example serves NEWS 2210, which outlines the use of
door-databases.

As a rule of thumb you could say that if your mapper just displays
information it is legal but anything beyond this (setting aliases,
performing actions based on the room you entered...) will get you in
trouble.

Please note that it is your responsibility to make sure your
mapping-program, if you decide to use one, is configured according to
this rule.
