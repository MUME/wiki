title: "Yell"
---

If you want all the players near you to hear something, yell it. Your
voice will travel better indoors, and doors will make it travel worse.

Please, yell rather than shout! Do not abuse this command.
[Orcs](Orc "wikilink") and [Trolls](Troll "wikilink") may hear
white-side players' yells and vice-versa.

Example:

` > yell Is Clint still alive?`
