**Blindness** is a level 6 [cleric](cleric "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). Cast upon a victim it will blind him
temporarily, thus causing his offensive and defensive capabilities to
worsen. The blinded creature will also be incapable of attacking or
opening and closing exits. When cast on [mobs](mob "wikilink") this is
especially powerful with the shoot/[flee](flee "wikilink") strategy .
During [PK](PK "wikilink") a successful blind can be a likely lethal
blow, because it requires superb area knowledge to escape without being
able to see the [room](room "wikilink") descriptions. Its success rate
depends primarily on the willpower of the opponent. The effects of the
spell last a few minutes and can be removed with the [Cure
Blindness](Cure_Blindness "wikilink") spell.

It is one of the most important cleric spells and should be learned to
the maximum possible. The Druid which lives northwest of
[Bree](Bree "wikilink") is known to be highly skilled in this spell.
