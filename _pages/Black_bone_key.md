\> **examine key**

This is a most strange piece of work. The key seems to be made from a
fragment

of bone, but where in the world does a creature have black bones? The
skull of

an unknown creature ornaments the key, its eyes two opaque worthless red

stones. On your hand it feels cold, and no matter how long you hold it,
the

key never seems to warm up.

\> **consider key**

It is a black bone key.

It weighs half a pound.
