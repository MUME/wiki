### Access / Justice

Ingrove is accessible for all white side players at day. At night the
gates will be opened only for citizens.

For non beornings, citizenship can be obtained by bringing a letter of
introduction to Loryen. The letter can be obtained through multiple
[quests](quest "wikilink").

Casting for non citizens is a [criminal offense](Justice "wikilink").
However, Old Hag north of the well, does not care about casting.

## Small Village

The small village north west of Ingrove and close to the Anduin river
can get attacked by an orcish raiding party (happening at full moons
during winter). If the village is left undefended its buildings will get
razed. If the raiding party is defeated, you can bring the butchered
corpse of the warg chieftain to Beorn who will reward the defense with a
letter of introduction to Ingrove.
