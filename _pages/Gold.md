One **gold** coin = twenty **silver** pennies = two thousand **copper**
pennies.

Elves have elven names for the same money. Use them instead if you are
an [Elf](Elf "wikilink"). (lauren = gold, celeb = silver, busc = copper)

To [drop](drop "wikilink"), or [give](give "wikilink") money, use
<amount> <kind>, as in:

` > give 4 silver bilbo`

When referring to an unknown amount, use 'coins':

` > take coins`

Money is useful for [buying](buy "wikilink") things, and for [storing
your equipment](rent "wikilink") while you are not playing.
