One gold coin = twenty silver pennies = two thousand copper pennies.
Elves have elven names for the same money. Use them instead if you are
an [Elf](Elf "wikilink"). (lauren = gold, celeb = silver, busc = copper)

To drop, or give money, use <amount> <kind>, as in:

` > give 4 silver bilbo`

When referring to an unknown amount, use 'coins':

` > take coins`

Money is useful for buying things, and for storing your equipment while
you are not playing.
