title: Acts
---

With **acts**, you can tell others what you are up to at the moment.
Usually when people see you in the [room](room "wikilink") they see:

` Gandalf is standing here.`

Using acts you can do the following:

` > acts making fancy smoke-rings`

and people will see:

` Gandalf is standing here making fancy smoke-rings.`

To turn the acts text off, just type "acts". The string will be reset
automatically when you [sit](sit "wikilink"), [stand](stand "wikilink"),
[ride](ride "wikilink"), move, and a bunch of other "active" things.

Abusing acts to give misleading information might lead to punishment.
