Rangers are heroes of the free people of Arda who willingly help new
players out with questions and other things. A Ranger (unlike Istari)
has the right to deny a newbie help and can also be fully involved in
the race wars. Rangers, however, are supposed to set a good example
among whitie heroes --- and will hence be severely punished by Elbereth
or the Valar if he or she misbehaves.

Since being a ranger is a prolonged volunteer service, rangers can --
unlike the [Istari](Istari "wikilink") -- go
[incognito](incognito "wikilink"). This way they will not be shown under
'who ranger'.

To become a Ranger, contact any member of the management(read: V+).
