title: Fourth Age
---

The Fourth Age and the ages that preceded it, are time periods from J.
R. R. Tolkien's universe of Middle-earth, described in his fantasy
writings. Because most of his fiction concerning Middle-earth deals with
earlier ages, there is relatively little material on these later ages
that followed the Third Age. The Fourth Age followed the defeat of
Sauron and the destruction of his One Ring, but did not officially begin
until after the Bearers of the Three Rings left Middle-earth for the
Uttermost West. [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Age)
