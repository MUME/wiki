Your **alignment** is basically a way of measuring your morals. Good
alignment is obtained by good actions and no evil deeds, evil alignment
is the opposite. You can also be neutral, and do as much good as evil.

Your alignment has effects in how efficiently you will be able to do
things, such as [fight](combat "wikilink") or [cast](cast "wikilink")
[spells](spell "wikilink"), in different parts of
[Arda](Arda "wikilink"). If your alignment is like to that of the
[zone](zone "wikilink") you are in, you will do best, but it is possible
for very virtuous, or very evil people to overcome some of the malus in
zones of alignment opposite to theirs. Thus, past a point, the more
extreme you are, the less penalty you suffer.

IMPORTANT: Note that the evil folks cannot enter some good
[cities](city "wikilink") and may be hunted by certain protectors of the
western lands. Thus being an evil character of a good
[race](race "wikilink") is likely to make your life hard and may often
get you killed. The more evil you are, the more likely you are to
suffer.

You can choose your basic alignment (in a given range, different for
each race). This is the alignment you start with, and the one you wish
to have.

Your actual alignment will change throughout the game, as a result of
your actions. There are a few points.

- It doesn't move more slowly as [levels](level "wikilink") increase.
- Players with an evil basic alignment won't necessarily improve their
  alignment when killing an evil being.
- Killing a player is an evil act, unless the player was very evil or
  was on [Sauron](Sauron "wikilink")'s list.
- If you don't kill anything, you'll gradually move towards your basic
  alignment.
- Killing a good being generally has a larger negative effect on
  alignment than the positive effect gained by killing evil.

You can see your alignment by using the [info](info "wikilink") command
or more specific *info %q*
