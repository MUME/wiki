![](Elrond.jpg "Elrond.jpg")''\]\] Back in the First Age of the Sun,
Lúthien Tinúviel, the daughter of the Elven King Thingol, fell in love
with the Man Beren. Lúthien's father disapproved of this and set Beren a
seemingly impossible task of reclaiming one of the stolen
[Silmarils](Silmaril "wikilink"). Despite many perils, Lúthien joined
Beren in this quest. With the help of Huan the Hound of Valinor, they
cut a Silmaril from the crown of [Morgoth](Morgoth "wikilink"). Of them
was born one child, the Half-elf Dior. The line would continue, and of
it was born Elwing who married Eärendil the Mariner, also a Half-elf,
the son of Idril and Tuor. It was Eärendil who returned the Silmaril to
the Valar and in return was granted to sail his ship through the
firmament, carrying the Silmaril to shine over [Arda](Arda "wikilink")
like a star. His two sons, Elros and [Elrond](Elrond "wikilink"), were
given the choice between mortality and immortality. Elros the Half-elven
chose to be a mortal [Man](Man "wikilink") and became the first king of
[Númenor](Númenor "wikilink"). Elrond the Half-elven chose to become an
immortal Elf; he founded [Rivendell](Rivendell "wikilink").

## Half-elves in [Mume](MUME "wikilink")

Half-elves are more common in MUME. They resemble Humans more so than
Elves, and like their mortal parentage are quite competent in most
classes. They are not immune to disease.
