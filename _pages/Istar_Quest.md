Any player above the level of 20, and with a sufficiently high
alignment, may opt to take the Istar Quest by sailing west to Valinor,
and visiting the Istari Sanctuary, where they may listen to the
Ainulindalë. If they are successful, they will be returned to level 21
and must spend the next two levels of their quest in the Meta levels
(see [Metamorph](Metamorph "wikilink")). Starting at level 23, they can
progress as an Istar (see [Istari](Istari "wikilink")) in humanoid form,
whose primary task is to assist new players, or continue as a metamorph.
At level 26 or higher, a player may ascend to immortality by again
sailing west to Valinor and listening to the Ainulindalë once again.

Once a player undertakes the quest he has no more than 60 real life days
in which to complete it. A player on the Istar Quest has certain
advantages over normal characters - for example, they need no longer
consume food or water, and their spells become less expensive. They also
gain the ability to change into animal form (see
[Metamorph](Metamorph "wikilink")). As such, and since he is in effect
an apprentice immortal, during the quest, the player is bound by far
stricter rules than normal characters. The player may take no active
part in the race wars, except to defend the strongholds of the west if
they are under invasion. A player on the istar quest is expected to
abide by the strictest standards as regards defence of all that is good.
Same-side player killing is forbidden, unless the victim is listed on
[Saurons List](Saurons_List "wikilink").

In the past the Valar have let many transgressions of our fledgeling
gods go without reprimand or serious penalty. This will not be the case
any longer. Be aware that failure to adequately complete all conditions
of the quest will have serious ramifications. The gift of Eru will be
lost. This applies at all levels of the quest, metamorph and istar.
