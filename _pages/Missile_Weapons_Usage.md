**Missile weapons** are one of the [weapon](weapon "wikilink") types on
[MUME](MUME "wikilink"). Unlike most other weapon
[skills](skill "wikilink"), missile is a [thief](thief "wikilink")
skill. To use a missile weapon (a [bow](bow "wikilink"), a
[crossbow](crossbow "wikilink") or a [sling](sling "wikilink")):

1\) Get some [missiles](ammunition "wikilink") of the correct type,
arrows for a bow, bolts for a crossbow, stones for a sling;

2\) Put them in a quiver, a bolt case or a pouch;

3\) Wear the quiver or boltcase or pouch;

4\) Wield a bow/crossbow/sling;

5\) Ask your best [warrior](warrior "wikilink") friend to
[buffer](buffer "wikilink") the opponent;

6\) '[shoot](shoot "wikilink") nasty' until no arrows;

7\) '[recover](recover "wikilink")' the missiles from the corpse and
from the ground.

Advantages of a bow? You are not in the melee.

If your friend isn't around,

5A) sneak up on the opponent

6A) shoot it

6B) [flee](flee "wikilink") or [escape](escape "wikilink"), trying not
to take much damage (and repeat from 5A until it is dead, you are dead,
you run out of arrows, etc.)

This may not seem likely to work, but if you are a scout with decent
skills at sneaking, dodging, escaping, etc., it actually does.

Moreover, if you are using a sling, you can REVEAL STONE in appropriate
places and you will never remain out of ammo.
