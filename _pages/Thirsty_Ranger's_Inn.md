The **Thirsty Ranger's Inn** is a tavern in
[Tharbad](Tharbad "wikilink"), located on Old Tower Street, with a
backdoor leading into Chapman's Lane. A
[Bartender](Bartender "wikilink") serves food and drinks there. The
[Rooftop Thieves' Guild](Rooftop_Thieves'_Guild "wikilink") is
accessible through a hidden grate in the main room, while a hidden
trapdoor leads from the cellar to the
[Sewers](Sewers_Thieves'_Guild "wikilink"). As can be expected, a few
[thieves](thief_(mobile) "wikilink") are usually lurking in the tavern,
so one would be wise to keep a close eye on their money.
