## Zaugurz Orc Information

- Thank you to p Elestir, p Daki, p Razoor and p Wingfoot for help with
  the initial version of this guide. Anyone who wants, please feel free
  to directly change or add information
- The aim for this guide is to encourage people to try zorc, flatten the
  zorc learning curve and find good equipment fast. Many items in this
  guide load in multiple spots, I have chosen the **easiest and
  fastest**. For additional details about items(like recent identify or
  how to get them) please check Faine’s MUME Page and maybe soon private
  wiki will be transferred to official wiki as well.

### Recommended stats and pracs

#### Warscout

- (by p Razoor/Riddar): Str:17 Int:7 Wis:6 Dex:18 Con:17 Wil:9 Per:18
  - Riddar is undoubtedly one of the best warscouts in the history of
    MUME together with Hezzel. Their logs on ER make outplaying the odds
    on warscouts easy when it’s anything but that.
  - Train neglect PER -2, Train improve STR +2
  - Riddar: Can also go -1 STR +1 CON for better HP/HP regen
  - Recommended \# of pracs by Razoor/Riddar:
    - Warrior
      - Bash 18
      - Endurance 12
      - Concussion 14(last prac needs to get +1OB)
      - Parry 6 (last prac needs to get +1PB)

#### Warrior

- Str:19 Int: 9 Wis: 7 Dex:15 Con:20 Wil: 11 Per:14.
  - Train neglect PER-2, train improve STR+1. When STR is trained to
    max, you can train WIS for better mixing.
  - You can easily go for envenom with these stats
  - Recommended % of pracs by p Wingfoot(one of the best pkers in MUME
    history):
    - Wingfoot: do not carry too many weapons like Conc+Smite+Slash, it
      decreases your DB because of weight and you get better pracs with
      just Conc. You can just do conc+slash and apply venom with slash
    - Endurance: max
    - Wilderness : max
    - Envenom: 61%
    - Dodge 61% (last prac needs to give +1db)
    - Parry 91%
    - Slash 86% (last prac needs to give +1ob)
    - Conc 101% (last prac needs to give +1ob)
    - Climb 91%
    - Swim 85%
    - Rescue try to max

### Zorc General re-eq progression

- Black padded boots in corpse on 'Dangerous Road' near Goblin Caves.
- Oil flask from floorboads e VT -\> goblet from packrats/PK
- Butcher knife from hunter NOC
- Keyring from Warrens Tower
- Web from e Anduin-\> Silvan satchel from Gwathion's quest heavier than
  web but wearable
- Purple scroll for kit upgrade. Kill Sabb for his kit upgrade.
- Old length of iron chain
- Shield: Reinforced Oaken Shield(spirit s Ingrove) -\> Cardolan -\>
  Arthedain -\> Gilded -\> Leaf-embossed(DG Drake, need 4) /
  Bejewelled(need 4)
- BSB from WC(need 3)
- Sable pouch is just extra weight and doesn't protect you from fire
  spells, eff vs fire means protection against Bloodwight/Mithnaur
- Root ring from DG Druidess(need 4)

### Picks

- Reveal picks Malardil Prison Cells. Picks also load: Crooked Creature
  SE Lorien(crackedwall)
- Kill Malardil for chance to get pick upgrade/stunpouch.
- 15g for sewers pick upgrade.
- These items have decent chance to get picks with Saruman upgrade +
  random upgrade: BSB, OIE book, Silvery Crown, purple scroll,
  bejewelled shield, defiled dwarven shield, BRD, dunadan blade,
  engraved hammer, ornate, warsword, PBS, banded ring

### Zorc Scout re-eq progression

- Bows: longbow from hunter in bushes s of NOC -\> Embellished bow from
  PK
- Daggers: Barbed fang from commander on Moria / Sacrificial knife from
  Goblin Shaman/Brolg/Nagash -\> Nimble Blade from quest solo -\> BRD
  from Sage(need 5)/PK
- Arrows: war arrows from ABR/archer in egate Moria -\> Quest arrows
  from Narag/Steel-Tipped arrows from PK
- Purple scroll for kit upgrade from EP
- Skip black wrappings because it very likely has no effect on orcs
  because Fror stated that effs are not cumulative, orcs are already eff
  vs poison. 2 necklaces don't give more protection from mental spells
  than just one, defiled dwarven shield + black amulet don't stack eff
  vs light etc.
- Fine soft leather gloves: Luxzum peg, Cinard
- Full plain set(hood/shirt/sleeves/pants) in Lorien down Largestump
  inside chest (picks +1 needed to pick)
- Soft leather riding skirt(only pants that give +1ob, LOADS WHERE???)
- Archer's Wristband(solo)
- Opaque/Lambent amulet(need group of 5 to farm)
- Can do Tharbad for iron ring/notracks with huge group by luring to
  staircase

### Zorc Warrior re-eq progression

- Concussion: cruelly spiked from zaugurz officer/Vurgl -\> engraved
  warhammer from SK(need 3, scout can solo) -\> ornate(need 4 and
  obsidian eye needs to blind at least 2)
- Stabbing: giant spear from giant -\> awlpike from Dol Guldur(need 4)
- Slashing: Dark broadsword from wraiths -\> EBS(need 4)
- Smiting: Warsword(GC with 3 warrior + scout shooting)/war mattock(4-5
  warriors)/burnished(soloable by scout).
  - Saruman can give claymore for these items: banded, BRD; dunadan
    blade, engraved warhammer, warsword, tower shield, “ysafg” scroll,
    BSB, OIE book, twisted crown.
  - One way to re-eq is to decay smite for stabbing, get giant spear
    until you get burnished/warsword, then decay stabbing and get smite
    back.
  - WS uses a lot of poison to envenom.
- Full fine chain loads on Caravan in DG
- Fine chain coif: LBF(need 3), spirit soldiers in GC that load BW
  key(need 4)
- Fine chain leggings: Luxzum peg
- Fine chain hauberk: Goblin warrior
- Fine chain sleeves: Men before Magus(solo), LBF(need 3)
- Fine chain gloves: Guardian/DT captain room/Blood-drenched orc, Moria
  (part of patrol, the one that doesn't move, wws from armoury)(need 4)
- Black warg fur(very heavy, only for xp): Skeleton in DG(solo) / warg
  pack-leader, in the pine forest south of DT(need 3) -\> soot-black
  bear hide(lighter than bwf, still very heavy, only for xp) d
  greatboulder entrance to Emyn -\> mantle from PK
- Horned helmet from Crazed Dwarf w gate Moria
- Black-thorned wristband(need 5 to farm it)
- White chains are significantly heavier than fine chains, especially
  jerkin and with MUME's targetting system you will get hit mainly on
  low Absorption spots anyway, I would skip white jerkin, rest is
  debatable. White coif(Moria shaman, Umuk), White leggings(recess
  Moria, Bulag), White hauberk(LBF when dark- need 3), White sleeves(s
  spectyre Moria- need 2)

### Basic General Scout stuff

- How sneak-shoot works: you stay hidden during shoot delay until you
  land the shot or you are revealed. It's like a shot against blind
  damage-wise. During bash it's better to just spam shoot instead of
  sneak-shooting with escape. Because escape is so slow. Only exception
  is when opponent has very high defenses even when bashed, then it
  MIGHT be better to sneak-shoot a bashed opponent but probably not.
- Mood doesn't affect backstab, you are automatically aggressive during
  stab. Better to stay wimpy because after stab, first hit connects as
  if you were aggressive but wimpy protects from subsequent hits.
- Scouts should keep weight at "tad uncomfortable" to escape
  successfully
- When two scouts try stab same target then one will fail but overall
  better chance to succeed unless one fails sneak, then both fail

### Narag arrow quest

- You get items to Narag, he gives you slender arrows, you cart them
  with "request 6". There is no way to distinguish between carted arrows
  and regular ones- the only difference is that carted arrows don't
  break.
- Need oak branch, iron bar(Malardil "The Castle Forges and Armoury",
  silver nugget("Smuggler's Barrow" inside crate near SSC d boulders),
  arrowheads(OIE 4x, DG 4x)
- 4x Arrowheads in OIE: 1) 4s entrance 2) 3s entrance+u+w+all u with
  eagle 3) w n w silverpanel "Metal Works" 4) "Rampart's End" s e u n e
  e from entrance. Need to kill 2 vines and they entangle and hurt- skip
  in sun, in dark try sneak past, if entangled shoot it dead.

### Most important herblores

- Antidote(solo), healing(solo), venom(solo), arachnia(solo),
  heightened(DG Magus- need 4, ask Carl for help how to solo as scout-
  it's a secret strat with bats probably), dark-draught(Emyn-need 5 to
  farm, scout can solo)
- Use infusion from Hillmen woman to get rid of negative effect

### Carting

- Orkish patrol that loads near 'Circle of Trees' area loads metal set;
  good for carting. Also skeletal warrior in rubble near crack.
- Cart value = gold value.
- Ginseng, black wrappings and OIE book are excellent credits.
- Twisted Crown is awful cart value, better to give Saruman

### Bulgotha credit levels from low to high

- In the north they had assumed that you had died.
- The garbage that you have sent is not fit to give to our slaves.
- Even now our craftsmen are preparing your rewards.
- The chieftain himself will send some of his own possessions to aid
  you.
- At your bidding, we will slay some of the weak and what they own we
  shall send to you.
- The riches of the Zaugurz, such as they are, are yours to command.

### Other Info

- Rent cost is much lower for zorcs than for other races because only
  source for coins is corpses. If you have good eq, rent cost can be
  significant and getting coins from corpses is time consuming,
  especially solo. Sewers is best place to farm coins.
- Zorcs can still stab in NOC, warrior bashes chieftain and scout goes
  in, wolfgate unlockable from inside to get out.
- Gate can't be unbarred when in combat
- Never flush in trail, hitting zaugurz scout makes you wanted
- Metals are only playable with STR 20+ and even then 95% of play would
  be for XP
- Keep at least 1 brown bottle per group
- Zorcs can do DK, can't get star charm tho because Azra is aggro, give
  palantir to Saruman
- Zorcs can do dodge quest. For scarred fell beast need like 3
  warriors + 3 scouts, not worth, easier to butcher the beast that flies
  around Herbalist(just stand there in open for 5min and it might come)
- You can rest on Anduin with raft in inventory and you're supersafe
  even in day
- You can skip Anduin muddle by going 3w 6s 1u from Old Ford.
- Need minimum 7 prac climb to visit Kral. Zorcs can kill Kral and get
  0-2 zaugurz-draughts.
- To return fast from Frozen North: "enter cart"
- Never "call open" zoc, just leave it unbarred if someone needs to run
  zoc fast
- If you give scalps to Bulgotha he sometimes gives you zaugurz-flask,
  you can give hillside letter to him for something as well.
- Zorcs can't get Blood of Sauron because Nagash is aggressive to zorcs
- Zaugurz orcs get higher base damage than Tarkhnarb, but Zaugurz orcs
  don't get group OB bonus like Tarkhnarb do
- Never flush in trail, hitting zaugurz scout makes you wanted
- Do not attack any Zaugurz Orc Mobs or you get wanted in ZOC, the
  higher your lvl the longer. You can, however, get the killing blow on
  a Zaugurz mob if there are no other Zaugurz mobs in room. Check your
  status with "tell Bulgotha status"
- These items have decent chance to get scroll from Saruman: Banded,
  Iron, Jewelled ring, ruby ring, Istar wand, PBS, Staff, AoD, Engraved
  hammer, Glamdring, Ornate, Sting, Warsword, beje, shining chain
  shirt/sleeves, bsb, gleaming, OIE book, twisted crown, tarnished
  copper wristband.
- These items have decent chance to get watch room kit from Saruman:
  Foci items, Jewelled ring, OiE Book, PBS, Jewelled ring, Palantir,
  Twisted crown, BSB. Watch room kit is detectable by detect magic and
  quite heavy.
