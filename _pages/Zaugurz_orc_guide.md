## Zaugurz Orc Information

- This is a Zaugurz Orc guide with all information I have been able to
  find out over the years. Compiled by Dearth, credit to all
  contributors given in the guide. Thank you to p Elestir, p Daki, p
  Razoor and p Wingfoot for help with the initial version of this guide.
  Anyone who wants, please feel free to directly change or add
  information
- The aim for this guide is to encourage people to try zorc, flatten the
  zorc learning curve and find good equipment fast. Many items in this
  guide load in multiple spots, I have chosen the **easiest and
  fastest**. For additional details about items(like recent identify or
  how to get them) please check Faine’s MUME Page and maybe soon private
  wiki will be transferred to official wiki as well.

### Recommended stats and pracs

#### Warscout

- (by p Razoor/Riddar): Str:17 Int:7 Wis:6 Dex:18 Con:17 Wil:9 Per:18
  - Riddar is undoubtedly one of the best warscouts in the history of
    MUME together with Hezzel. Their logs on ER make outplaying the odds
    on warscouts easy when it’s anything but that.
  - Train neglect PER -2, Train improve STR +2
  - Riddar: Can also go -1 STR +1 CON for better HP/HP regen
  - Max track 102%. Probably unnecessary to max it
  - Recommended \# of pracs by Razoor/Riddar:
    - Warrior
      - Bash 18
      - Endurance 12
      - Concussion 14(last prac needs to get +1OB)
      - Parry 6 (last prac needs to get +1PB)
    - Scout
      - Envenom 10
      - Attack 12
      - Missile 13
      - Dodge 10(last prac needs to get +1DB)
      - Escape 12
      - Hide 6
      - Pick 6
      - Max Backstab+Sneak
      - Piercing 101%(last prac needs to get +1OB)
      - Search 1
    - Ranger
      - Awareness 1(for track)
      - Bandage 5
      - Climb 9
      - Swim 9
      - Track 25
      - Wilderness 17

#### Warrior

- Recommended % of pracs by p Wingfoot/Tankist(one of the best pkers in
  MUME history):
  - Wingfoot's advice on how to prac torc warrior(not based on stats
    above):
    - Do not carry too many weapons like Conc+Smite+Slash, it decreases
      your DB because of weight and you get better pracs with just Conc.
      You can just do conc+slash and apply poison with slash
    - For group PK I've heard experienced players don't get weaponskill
      above 91% (due to parry split bonus) and invest pracs to something
      else. Also some maxdamage/ob warriors dont get dodge or any other
      thief skill etc.
    - Endurance: max
    - Wilderness : max
    - Envenom: 61%
    - Dodge 61% (last prac needs to give +1db)
    - Parry 91% (last prac needs to give +1pb)
    - Slash 86% (last prac needs to give +1ob)
    - Conc 101% (last prac needs to give +1ob)
    - Climb 91%
    - Swim 85%
    - Rescue for soloing warrior I would have like 3-4 pracs for start

### Zorc General re-eq progression

- Black padded boots in corpse on 'Dangerous Road' near Goblin Caves.
  FGC from Eoghha.
- Oil flask from floorboads e VT(best weight to size ratio) -\> goblet
  from packrats/PK
- Butcher knife from hunter NOC
- Keyring from Warrens Tower
- Web from e Anduin-\> Silvan satchel from Gwathion's quest heavier than
  web but wearable
- Purple scroll for kit upgrade. Kill Sabb for his kit upgrade.
- Old length of iron chain (easy to swimdie with low swim when eel hits
  and you flee wrong)
- Shield: Reinforced Oaken Shield(spirit 5w 7s w Ingrove Gate) -\>
  Cardolan(Malardil) -\> Arthedain(Ferny) -\> Gilded -\>
  Leaf-embossed(DG Drake, need 4) / Bejewelled(need 4)
- BSB from WC(need 3)
- Sable pouch is just extra weight and doesn't protect you from fire
  spells like icy ring, eff vs fire means protection against
  Bloodwight/Mithnaur
- Root ring from DG Druidess(need 4)
- Vellum from Dunland. Need star sapphire to loot from Ghostly
  Captain(need 4).
- Opaque/Lambent amulet(need group of 5 to farm)
- Durbuk-hai commanders in Emyn can load enchanted weapons

### Picks

- Reveal picks Malardil Prison Cells. Picks also load: Crooked Creature
  SE Lorien(crackedwall)
- Kill Malardil for chance to get pick upgrade/stunpouch.
- 15g for sewers pick upgrade.
- These items have decent chance to get picks with Saruman upgrade +
  random upgrade: BSB, OIE book, Silvery Crown, purple scroll,
  bejewelled shield, defiled dwarven shield, BRD, dunadan blade,
  engraved hammer, ornate, warsword, PBS, banded ring

### Zorc Scout re-eq progression

- Bows: longbow from hunter in bushes s of NOC or crazed dwarf above
  Moria wgate -\> BHSB from dunland orc caves. BHSB has small load% on 2
  Dunlending hunters e Wyrdda -\> Embellished bow from PK
- Daggers: Shortsword from tipsy/stoor village at LB -\> Barbed fang
  from commander in Moria n w detritus / Sacrificial knife from Goblin
  Shaman/Brolg/Nagash -\> Nimble Blade from quest solo -\>
  neutral-chanted fang from a random Emyn captain(needs ~3 zorcs) -\>
  BRD from Sage(need 5)/PK
- Arrows: war arrows from ABR/archer in egate Moria -\> Quest arrows
  from Narag/Steel-Tipped arrows from PK
- Skip black wrappings because it very likely has no effect on orcs
  because Fror stated that effs are not cumulative, orcs are already eff
  vs poison. 2 necklaces don't give more protection from mental spells
  than just one, defiled dwarven shield + black amulet don't stack eff
  vs light etc.
- Fine soft leather gloves
  - Luxzum peg
  - Cinard(rarely)
  - Randomly on some of the Dunland Captains
- Full plain set(hood/shirt/sleeves/pants) in Lorien down Largestump
  inside chest (picks +1 needed to pick)
- Fine plain dress & plain flowing skirt - lighter than plain
  - Skeleton near vulture around archer wrist tower
- Soft cloth cap - lighter than plain
  - Tipsy thief s of Rdell
  - In chest up in Farmer Grey's attic (past his yelling wife), nw of
    Jasper's Tavern, s of Morthan
- Archer's wristguard (solo - Throulhuk)
- Can do Tharbad for iron ring/notracks with big group by luring 5 mobs
  to staircase, then picking shut, repeat until Chief is part of the 5
  that comes.

### Zorc Warrior re-eq progression

- Concussion: cruelly spiked from zaugurz officer/Vurgl -\> engraved
  warhammer from SK(need 2, scout can solo) -\> neutral-chanted heavy
  star from a random Emyn captain -\> ornate(need 4 and obsidian eye
  needs to blind at least 2)
  - Concussion is the best because it does 25% more damage against
    metal. So ornate hit against metal does 12.7dmg\*1.25=15.8dmg
- Stabbing: giant spear from giant -\> awlpike from Drake in Dol
  Guldur(need 4)
- Slashing: Dark broadsword from wraiths -\> EBS(need 4)
  - On the wraiths in the tower just west of the Canyon Trail
  - On wraith just outside Old Fornost
  - Shade in tower east of Thorns between Khuzur and ABR
  - Shade north of Vale village
  - At bald orc south of Old Forest Road in a rack
  - On wraiths at entrance to strange black helmet place
  - On wraiths guarding entrance to Ghostly Captain
  - On wraiths east of Rivendell in area where GCM pops
- Smiting: Warsword(GC with 3 warrior + scout shooting)/war mattock(4-5
  warriors)/burnished(soloable by scout).
  - Saruman can give claymore for these items: banded, BRD; dunadan
    blade, engraved warhammer, warsword, tower shield, “ysafg” scroll,
    BSB, OIE book, twisted crown.
  - One way to re-eq is to decay smite for stabbing, get giant spear
    until you get burnished/warsword, then decay stabbing and get smite
    back.
  - WS uses a lot of poison to envenom.
- Full fine chain loads on Caravan in DG(caravan itself loads rarely)
- Fine chain coif:
  - LBF(need 3)
  - Spirit soldiers in GC that load BW key(need 4)
  - Orkish Chieftain in Dunland(need 5)
- Fine chain leggings:
  - Luxzum peg(solo)
  - Crazed dwaf wgate(solo)
  - DT(need 5)
- Fine chain hauberk:
  - Men before Magus in DG(solo)
  - On one of the goblin warriors following Goblin Shaman in Goblin
    Caves near DT(unverified)
  - LBF(need 3)
  - The gatekeeper at Wulfston (Broghha's village)(need 4)
- Fine chain sleeves:
  - Men before Magus(solo)
  - 1.orc in Ancient Tower south of Brolg when popped Dark(need 2)
  - LBF(need 3)
  - On Gumak in OOC(need 3)
  - 3.Bodyguard at Guardian NOC(need 4)
  - DT captain room when dark(need 5)
- Fine chain gloves:
  - Guardian(need 4)
  - Blood-drenched orc Moria (part of patrol, the one that doesn't move,
    wws from armoury)(need 4)
  - DT captain room(need 5)
- Fine metal boots:
  - EP orcs(need 2)
  - GC(need 4)
- Black warg fur(8lb very heavy, only for xp):
  - Skeleton in DG guarded by bats(solo)
  - Warg pack-leader in the pine forest south of DT(need 3)
- Soot-black bear hide(7lb-so lighter than bwf, but still very heavy,
  only for xp) -\> mantle from PK
  - d greatboulder entrance to Emyn
- Horned helmet:
  - from Crazed Dwarf w gate Moria
  - In the sarcophagus guarded by the stone statues, under 'stonehatch'
    northeast of Lorien.
  - In one of the mounds in the Tangle (southern part of OFR)
- If you wear full fine chain then you could wear only knee-high boots
  to avoid switching between metal boots/black boots. There is a trade
  off because their absorption is slightly lower so you will get hit on
  feet a lot but you sometimes get +1DB from lower weight and no
  switching.
- Black-thorned wristband(Emyn- need 5 to farm it)
- White chains are significantly heavier than fine chains, especially
  jerkin and with MUME's targetting system you will get hit mainly on
  low Absorption spots anyway, I would skip white jerkin, rest is
  debatable. White coif(Moria shaman, Umuk), White leggings(recess
  Moria, Bulag), White hauberk(LBF when dark- need 3), White sleeves(s
  spectyre Moria- need 2)

### Basic General Scout stuff

- How sneak-shoot works: you stay hidden during shoot delay until you
  land the shot or you are revealed. It's like a shot against blind
  damage-wise. During bash it's better to just spam shoot instead of
  sneak-shooting with escape. Because escape is so slow. Only exception
  is when opponent has very high defenses even when bashed, then it
  MIGHT be better to sneak-shoot a bashed opponent but probably not.
- Mood doesn't affect backstab, you are automatically aggressive during
  stab. Better to stay wimpy because after stab, first hit connects as
  if you were aggressive but wimpy protects from subsequent hits.
- Scouts should keep weight at "tad uncomfortable" to escape
  successfully
  - It is unclear how weight affects sneak+backstab. Jaagern: "Weight
    seems a lot less of an issue than what is commonly perceived. I’m
    NEVER on a tad uncomfortable, sometimes I’m 20 lbs above it. Doesn’t
    seem to affect my success
    much."(http://www.elvenrunes.de/cgi-bin/logs/show.m?log=b61819,73671&disc=1&sort=1&snew=1&omode=&all=0&typ=)
- 95% stab+sneak works for XP(By Jaagern & Praska:
  <http://www.elvenrunes.de/cgi-bin/logs/show.m?log=b61819,73671&disc=1&sort=1&snew=1&omode=&all=0&typ=>)
- When two scouts try stab same target then one will fail but overall
  better chance to succeed unless one fails sneak, then both fail

### Narag arrow quest

- You give items to Narag, he gives you slender arrows, you cart them
  with "request 6". There is no way to distinguish between carted arrows
  and regular ones- the only difference is that carted arrows don't
  break.
- Need oak branch, iron bar(Malardil "The Castle Forges and Armoury",
  silver nugget("Smuggler's Barrow" inside crate near SSC d boulders),
  arrowheads(OIE 4x, DG 4x)
- 4x Arrowheads in OIE:
  - 4s entrance
  - 3s entrance+u+w+all u with eagle
  - w n w silverpanel "Metal Works"
  - "Rampart's End" s e u n e e from entrance. Need to kill 2 vines and
    they entangle and hurt- skip in sun, in dark try sneak past, if
    entangled shoot it dead.

### Most important herblores

- If you have upgraded kit you mishmash less and often you produce
  double potions.
- Antidote(solo). Blackberries decay so many people keep extra kit with
  berries inside. Each kit is 1lb.
  - Brown bottle from hillmen lasts 1h 10min before decaying
  - Brown bottle mixed by player lasts about 2h 45min before decaying.
- Healing(solo - kill Vurgl in Emyn, butcher and bring head to Kral) +2
  con, +15 hp regeneration 63 hours. After that, +5 hp regeneration, -2
  moves for 63 hours. Produces philtre, philtre lasts 5minutes in
  inventory.
  - Foxtail is hard to get because loads rarely and is part of the most
    powerful herblore for darkies. Foxtail loadspots:
    - N Ingrove: From outside Narv's house: all w, all n, 1e, 1s.
    - Southwest of Tharbad near the shipwreck 1n from "Small Cottage"
    - w s from entrance to Mormaeg.
    - from outside Halamor's: w 3n.
    - n, max e, nneneessww from e brush at Tall Orc
    - 2e from the Mossy Clearing in Small Ash Grove resting spot south
      of GH;
- Venom(solo)
- Arachnia(solo)
- Heightened-senses- Awareness +30%, track +50% for ??? hours (DG Magus-
  need 4, ask Carl for help how to solo as scout- it's a secret strat
  with luring bats to top tower probably, please be careful, we almost
  mobbed trying it)
- Dark-draught - Great for stabbing Bree in sun(Emyn- need 5 to farm,
  Elestir said scout can solo)
  - Cunning Durbūk-hai shamans in Emyn-nu-Fuin carry pale, leathery
    scroll in their belt pouches. It's random which one.
- Use infusion from Hillmen woman to get rid of negative effects of any
  herblore

### Carting

- Orkish patrol that loads near 'Circle of Trees' area loads metal set;
  good for carting. Also skeletal warrior in rubble near crack.
- Cart value = gold value.
- Ginseng, black wrappings and OIE book are excellent credits.
- Twisted Crown is awful cart value, better to give Saruman

### Bulgotha credit levels from low to high

- In the north they had assumed that you had died.
- The garbage that you have sent is not fit to give to our slaves.
- Your contributions are remembered, but not that well.
- Even now our craftsmen are preparing your rewards.
- The chieftain himself will send some of his own possessions to aid
  you.
- At your bidding, we will slay some of the weak and what they own we
  shall send to you.
- The riches of the Zaugurz, such as they are, are yours to command.

### Other Info

- To mend and resize, find Ammûnk south of the cart. He can only mend
  one item at a time.
- New useful command "score report" is built in reporting, so you don't
  display mana in your client specific alias and you don't need to
  change it when switching between sides
- There is now no difference between "kill" and "hit" when you want to
  switch targets when multiple targets are hitting you
- Rent cost is much lower for zorcs than for other races because only
  source for coins is corpses. If you have good eq, rent cost can be
  significant and getting coins from corpses is time consuming,
  especially solo. Sewers is best place to farm coins.
- Zorcs can still stab in NOC, warrior bashes chieftain and scout goes
  in, wolfgate unlockable from inside to get out.
- Gate can't be unbarred when in combat
- Metals are only playable with STR 20+ and even then 95% of play would
  be for XP
- Keep at least 1 brown bottle per group
- Zorcs can do DK, can't get star charm tho because Azra is aggro, give
  palantir to Saruman
- Zorcs can do dodge quest. For scarred fell beast center room need like
  3 warriors + 3 scouts, not worth, easier to butcher the beast that
  flies around Herbalist(just stand there in open for 5min and it might
  come)
- You can rest on Anduin with boat in inventory and you're supersafe
  even in day
  - Raft loads from way/slide all e, 1w, 2n, e, 2n
  - Boat loads from Old Ford: e, 3s, 4e
- You can skip Anduin muddle by going 3w 6s 1u from Old Ford.
- Need minimum 7 prac climb to visit Kral. If you fail climb try drop
  eq. Zorcs can kill Kral and get 0-2 zaugurz-draughts.
- To return fast from Frozen North: "enter cart"
- Never "call open" zoc, just leave it unbarred if someone needs to run
  zoc fast
- If you give scalps to Bulgotha he sometimes gives you zaugurz-flask,
  you can give hillside letter to him as well(We gave it to him 5x, only
  got achievement).
- Zorcs can't get Blood of Sauron because Nagash is aggressive to zorcs
- Zaugurz orcs get higher base damage than Tarkhnarb, but Zaugurz orcs
  don't get group OB bonus like Tarkhnarb do
- Never flush in trail, hitting zaugurz scout makes you wanted
- Obsidian eye and black candles are 2 items that work well against
  charmies (charmies seem to all have terrible willpower)
- Do not attack any Zaugurz Orc Mobs or you get wanted in ZOC, the
  higher your lvl the longer. You can, however, get the killing blow on
  a Zaugurz mob if there are no other Zaugurz mobs in room. Check your
  status with "tell Bulgotha status"
- These items have decent chance to get scroll from Saruman: Banded,
  Iron, Jewelled ring, ruby ring, Istar wand, PBS, Staff, AoD, Engraved
  hammer, Glamdring, Ornate, Sting, Warsword, beje, shining chain
  shirt/sleeves, bsb, gleaming, OIE book, twisted crown, tarnished
  copper wristband.
- These items have decent chance to get watch room kit from Saruman:
  Foci items, Jewelled ring, OiE Book, PBS, Jewelled ring, Palantir,
  Twisted crown, BSB. Watch room kit is detectable by detect magic and
  quite heavy.
- Orcs can't enter coach like BNs can
- Stab safe regen places:
  - Behind leaves near tipsy
- Vile fetish can be traded with Kral for Dark Draught
  - Loads on named D-Orc mobs in the Mountains of Mirkwood. Also loads
    on Urdan patrol leaders, and (occasionally) on cunning shaman.
- To minmax orc moves, avoid terrain with Forest, Field, Brush,
  Shallows(source: <https://mume.org/help/terrain>)
