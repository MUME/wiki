When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing
**quit**. Note that whatever stuff you might be carrying with you is
simply left on the ground (other than [money](money "wikilink")). If you
wish to have your [equipment](equipment "wikilink") put away until you
are able to return, you'll have to find an [inn](inn "wikilink") and
'[rent](rent "wikilink")'.

If you just type 'quit', and you are actually carrying anything that
would be abandoned on the ground, you are asked to confirm your
intentions. You can do that by typing 'quit for real' ('quit
immediately' and 'quit now' works too, but it's cooler to write \`quit
for real').

Unlike most commands, 'quit' can't be abbreviated. Writing 'q', 'qu' or
'qui' just shows the message 'You have to write "quit" - no less - to
quit!'.
