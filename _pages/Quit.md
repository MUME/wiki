When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing \`quit'.
Note that whatever stuff you might be carrying with you is simply left
on the ground (other than money). If you wish to have your equipment put
away until you are able to return, you'll have to find an inn and
\`rent'.

If you just type \`quit', and you are actually carrying anything that
would be abandoned on the ground, you are asked to confirm your
intentions. You can do that by typing \`quit for real' (\`quit
immediately' and \`quit now' works too, but it's cooler to write \`quit
for real').
