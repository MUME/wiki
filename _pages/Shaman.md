The **shaman** is a class restricted to the [Tarkhnarb
orcs](Tarkhnarb_orc "wikilink"). They are a combination of the
[Mage](Mage "wikilink") and [Cleric](Cleric "wikilink") class, using
both schools of [magic](magic "wikilink") without
[penalty](Practice_Penalty "wikilink"). Shamans are an interesting
[class](class "wikilink") because, unlike their counterparts, their
[magic](magic "wikilink") is often weak and thus the player has to be
creative in shaping his shaman, supplementing him with other skills to
make him an effective killing machine.
