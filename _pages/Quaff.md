**Quaff** is used to drink a [potion](potion "wikilink"), and gain its
effects. Note that [drink](drink "wikilink") will also work, but if you
are not thirsty you will not be able to drink the potion, while you will
always be able to quaff it.

On [MUME](MUME "wikilink"), all potions are made by characters using
[herbs](herblore "wikilink").
