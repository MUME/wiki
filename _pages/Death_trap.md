title: "Death trap"
---

A death trap is a room where anyone who enters dies immediately.
Examples of death traps are bottomless pits, gaping precipices, or
lava-filled lakes. Upon entering a death trap, you will have one chance
to retrace your steps. Failure means instant death; your equipment,
except some particular cases, will be lost forever. If you are leading a
group and you stumble in a DT, your followers will see your fatal
mistake and will not follow you.

All the death traps in Arda are clearly marked: if you read the
descriptions thoroughly, and if you "[Look](Look "wikilink")
<direction>" when you are in doubt, you should have little chance of
entering a death trap. Some DTs are lit so you can have little doubts
about what they are - e.g. "In Mid-Air", but others are not - e.g. "A
Dark Hole" would look silly if lit. Many death-traps cannot be fled
into, but this is not a rule.

Unless you recently met \*an Enemy\*, dying in a death trap does not
reduce your experience, but it will decrease your travel points total.
Should it fall below the minimum required for your present level, you
will lose a level. Trolls are the only exception: falling into a DT for
a troll entails a small loss of experience points.

If you walk into a death trap after you recently met \*an Enemy\*, you
may suffer a pkill death. See [Death](Death "wikilink") for more
details.
