![](Cave_troll.jpg "Cave_troll.jpg")''\]\] Of all Sauron's servants,
**Trolls** have the greatest physical might. These huge figures may be
the corrupted form of tree spirits, created by
[Morgoth](Morgoth "wikilink") in the [Great
Darkness](Great_Darkness "wikilink"). Trolls are normally incapable of
withstanding the pureness of daylight. Trolls are very large (twelve
feet tall or more) humanoids of great strength and poor intellect. Their
blood is black and so hot, that when it falls, it sizzles on the floor.
Most trolls still remain under control of [Sauron](Sauron "wikilink")
and large numbers reside around the northern [Misty
Mountains](Misty_Mountains "wikilink") and the
[Trollshaws](Trollshaws "wikilink").

## Trolls in [Mume](MUME "wikilink")

The sheer might of a Troll makes them the most capable
[bare-handed](Unarmed "wikilink") fighters. They have extremely low
thinking ability, and their bulk gives them very sluggish movement.
Trolls can only play [Warriors](Warrior "wikilink") effectively. Player
trolls live within the Trollshaws in a gigantic cave-system known as the
[Warrens](Warrens "wikilink"). Trolls in Mume are treated differently to
most other races:

- They may not become immortal.
- They cannot cast [spells](spell "wikilink") at all.
- They have access to no shops.
- They do heavy damage [barehanded](Unarmed "wikilink").
- They can not practice leadership.
- They have the ability to see in the dark without a light source.
- They suffer [tremendous damage under sunlight](Sundeath "wikilink").
- A Troll will see all non-Trolls except [Black
  Númenóreans](Black_Númenórean "wikilink") in the room by their race
  name (\*an Elf\*, -Snarf the Orc- etc). The same applies for
  non-Trolls seeing Trolls. The one exception to this rule is that a
  Troll grouped by a [Black Númenórean](Black_Númenórean "wikilink")
  will be able to see Orcs in their group by name.

Player-controlled Trolls are deemed to be of the Hill Troll, Mountain
Troll or Cave Troll strain (as opposed to Forest Trolls and Olog-Hai).
Those trolls who have reached 21st level are given the standard title
[Olog-Hai](Olog-Hai "wikilink"). This does not mean they have swapped
race. Instead it means simply what it says: Troll-Race, i.e. a Troll. It
is an honorific title if you like, saying they have established
themselves as a great troll. It is certainly better than Lord of Trolls.
Since they are not true Olog-Hai, they suffer
[Sundeath](Sundeath "wikilink") just like other trolls.

## Subraces

The three subraces have the following modifiers:

- MUME Hill Trolls\[1\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- MUME's Hill Trolls have a number of bonuses. These include:

`* They deal extra damage to stunned opponents when wielding a one-handed or`
`  two-handed concussion weapon.`

`* They enjoy storming into battle and get a higher offensive bonus when`
`  aggressive or berserk.`

`* They can burrow under certain conditions.`

- MUME Cave Trolls \[1\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

MUME's Cave Trolls have a number of bonuses. These include:

`* They have slightly increased hit point regeneration. This bonus is increased`
`  when in a cave or tunnel.`

`* They have huge bashes which may cause the victim to hurtle and collide with`
`  a nearby engaged target.`

`* Cave Trolls are more likely to cause their bashed victims to hurtle into other targets if they are dextrous and have mastered their weapon class.`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

MUME's Mountain Trolls have a number of bonuses. These include:

`* They will sometimes hit nearby targets with wild attacks when engaged in`

`  and reduced move cost.`

`* They can shake trees, push boulders, drag corpses, use slow doors, and dig`
`  more swiftly and effortlessly.`

`* Mountain Trolls are more likely to use wild attacks against other targets if they are dextrous and have mastered their weapon class. They are able to do so even when blinded!`

## Opinion

Sécrêt's troll advice from the Palantíri on Elvenrunes:

"Yes, my first advice is: the troll race is a special species with its
own written and unwritten rules, its own social status and its own way
of [pking](PK "wikilink") and xping. In my opinion there is three
different trolls: the trackless troll with defence, the berserker
[hitter](Unarmed "wikilink") and the [track](track "wikilink") troll.
Make up your mind before you level up your troll because the playstyle
is very different. As troll, you need to know which areas are dark and
which are light, which is the most important. If you have experience as
[puke](Pukes "wikilink")/[orc](orc "wikilink")/[bn](Black_Númenórean "wikilink")
then the troll race is pretty easy, BESIDES in pk situations with
sunlight and other things. Just going [berserk](mood "wikilink") works
if you don’t care to die however if you don’t just want to die like a
piece of meat, trolls take time to master :)'

Real newbie players best make an unarmed troll and learn where to get
[boots](a_pair_of_smooth,_black_boots "wikilink") and
[fgc](a_forest_green_cloak "wikilink") and go play around."

Qzapaboo hill troll: If and when you die from \*SUNDEATH\* use the
reborn command to reset trophies so you get all the exp you would like a
level 1. In order to use it you have to have no exp, don't forget unless
you like the long grind you have been warned... it also resets your
quest progress. As a troll that uses weapons they aren't always a sure
thing to find starting out or after a death, so use what you can find.
For those smiters (two-handed weapon users) you wont be able to get the
skill right away just be patient till you can.
