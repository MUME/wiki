title: "Troll"

Of all Sauron's servants, trolls have the greatest physical might. These
huge figures may be the corrupted form of tree spirits, created by
Morgoth in the Great Darkness. Trolls are normally incapable of
withstanding the pureness of daylight.

## MUME TROLLS

The sheer might of a Troll makes them the most capable bare-handed
fighters. They have extremely low thinking ability, and their bulk gives
them very sluggish movement. Trolls can only play Warriors effectively.
Trolls in Mume are treated differently to most other races:

- They may not become immortal.
- They cannot cast spells at all.
- They have access to no shops.
- They do heavy damage barehanded.
- They can not practice leadership.
- They have the ability to see in the dark without a light source.
- They suffer tremendous damage under sunlight.
- A Troll will see all non-Trolls except Black Númenóreans in the room
  by their race name (\*an Elf\*, -Snarf the Orc- etc). The same applies
  for non-Trolls seeing Trolls. The one exception to this rule is that a
  Troll grouped by a Black Númenórean will be able to see Orcs in their
  group by name.

Player-controlled Trolls are deemed to be of the Hill Troll, Mountain
Troll or Cave Troll strain (as opposed to Forest Trolls and Olog-Hai).
Those trolls who have reached 21st level are given the standard title
Olog-Hai. This does not mean they have swapped race. Instead it means
simply what it says: Troll-Race, i.e. a Troll. It is an honorific title
if you like, saying they have established themselves as a great troll.
It is certainly better than Lord of Trolls. Since they are not true
Olog-Hai, they suffer SUNDEATH just like other trolls.
