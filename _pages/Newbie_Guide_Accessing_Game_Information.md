**Newbie Guide Accessing Game Information**

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

"I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to Gondor. In former days the
members of my order had been

`well received there.... Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, `

and grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and
books."

Gandalf, JRRT, The Fellowship of the Ring
