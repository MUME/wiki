\> A bear is here, covered with coarse black fur.
\> **look bear**
The bear is covered with a thick black fur that is very coarse. It is
said
that some black bears may actually be able to outrun horses. Both
black
bears and grizzly bears have very sharp claws that protrude from their
paws.
Their paws look dangerous and are perfect for scooping fish out of the
water.
