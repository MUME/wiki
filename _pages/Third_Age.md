title: Third Age
---

The **Third Age** began after the first downfall of
[Sauron](Sauron "wikilink"), when he was defeated by the [Last Alliance
of Elves and Men](Last_Alliance_of_Elves_and_Men "wikilink") following
the downfall of [Númenor](Númenor "wikilink").

This age was characterized by the waning of the
[Elves](Elves "wikilink"), the rise and decline of the exiled Númenorean
kingdoms, and the slow recovery of Sauron's power.

It lasted for 3021 years, until Sauron was again defeated, this time
finally, when his [Ruling Ring](The_One_Ring "wikilink") was destroyed.
When [Bilbo](Bilbo_Baggins "wikilink") and
[Frodo](Frodo_Baggins "wikilink") left Middle-earth for the [Uttermost
West](Valinor "wikilink"), the [Fourth Age](Fourth_Age "wikilink")
began.
