Fell Beasts are the Darkie side analogon of the [Great
Eagles](Great_Eagle "wikilink") to enable fast travelling of great
distances.

Calling requires a black amulet instead of a [focus](focus "wikilink")
item. The amulet is given by Sage for a Red Amulet which loads at
Necromancer.

These locations should work additionally for destinations, need to test:
goblintown, goblin town, new orc caves, moria, dark tower.

Apart from the calling requirements and the keyword 'beast', the
mechanics are the same as explained for the [Great
Eagle](Great_Eagle "wikilink").
