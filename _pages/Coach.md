Coaches are a fairly safe, comfortable means of transportation between
towns and waystations on Arda.

Those wishing to travel by coach, may obtain a coach ticket sold in
groceries, bazaars, travellers' shops, as well as some inns. Timetables
found at coach stations often ofter hints as to where tickets may be
bought.

To board a coach, wait at the designated coach station for the coach to
arrive and open its doors. You may [Look](Look "wikilink") COACH, to
ensure you are not boarding the wrong line. [Enter](Enter "wikilink")
COACH will begin your journey. In the event there is more than one coach
at a station, LOOK 2.COACH, ENTER 3.COACH, will help you select the
right coach. Once reaching your destination, LEAVE to exit the coach.
Remember if you exit the coach at an intermediate station, you will need
a new ticket to continue your journey.

There are currently two coaches in the game, driven by Bill Cry and his
son Pete, which connect Fornost to Tharbad, stopping in Bree and at some
intermediate points. More coaches might be added in the future.
