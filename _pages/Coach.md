**Coaches** are a safe, comfortable means of transportation between
[towns](town "wikilink") and waystations on [Arda](Arda "wikilink").

Those wishing to travel by coach, may obtain a coach ticket sold in
groceries, bazaars, travellers' shops, as well as some
[inns](inn "wikilink"). Timetables found at coach stations often offer
hints as to where tickets may be bought.

To board a coach, wait at the designated coach station for the coach to
arrive and open its doors. You may

`> `[`look`](look "wikilink")` coach`

to ensure you are not boarding the wrong line.

To begin your journey use

`> `[`enter`](enter "wikilink")` coach`

In the event there is more than one coach at a station, 'look 2.coach',
'enter 2.coach', will help you select the right coach. Once reaching
your destination, you can exit the coach with

`> `[`leave`](leave "wikilink")

Remember if you exit the coach at an intermediate station, you will need
a new ticket to continue your journey. You will be automatically forced
to leave when reaching the endpoints of the coach line.

While riding the coach you cannot cast. You can see the current room the
coach is travelling in by typing

`> `[`look`](look "wikilink")` window`

There are currently two coaches in the game, driven by Bill Cry and his
son Pete, which connect [Fornost](Fornost "wikilink") to
[Tharbad](Tharbad "wikilink"), stopping in [Bree](Bree "wikilink") and
at some intermediate points. More coaches might be added in the future.
