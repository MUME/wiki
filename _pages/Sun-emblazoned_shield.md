This large rounded metal shield looks able to protect almost the full
length of a soldier's body, when used properly. The shield's face has
been painted a grassy green colour. The embossed crest portrays a golden
sun blazoned upon the green background.

It is a sun-emblazoned shield (flawless, fresh). It weighs two stone and
one pound. It fits you well.
