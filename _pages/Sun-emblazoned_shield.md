title: Sun-emblazoned shield
---

\> **look shield**

This large rounded metal [shield](shield "wikilink") looks able to
protect almost the full length of

a soldier's body, when used properly. The shield's face has been painted
a

grassy green colour. The embossed crest portrays a golden sun blazoned
upon the

green background.

\> **consider shield**

It is a sun-emblazoned shield (flawless, fresh).

It weighs two stone and one pound.

It fits you well.

## Opinions

The shield is a rare item, it loads on Haldin at the Mark in
[Dunland](Dunland "wikilink"). It gives slightly less [parry
bonus](parry_bonus "wikilink") when compared to a [bejewelled
shield](a_bejewelled_shield "wikilink"), approx. 3pb less on a full
metal dwarf warrior with 20 strength.
