\> **look wolf**
This great beast sniffs the air for potential victims. Although from
afar it
seems to be nothing more than a large wolf, its form is smoky and
indistinct.
Its intelligent looking eyes have an evil glare and rows of sharp teeth
grind
in its maw, in anticipation of consuming sentient flesh. Such a creature
will
not relent on chasing a possible prey, which might be you.
