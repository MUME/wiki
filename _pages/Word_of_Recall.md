**Word of Recall** is a level 11 [cleric](cleric "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). It takes the caster to the closest *safe*
location in the [zone](zone "wikilink"). *Safe* in this context means
safe from [mobiles](mobile "wikilink") but not necessarily from
[pk](pk "wikilink"). In comparison to the
[Teleport](Teleport "wikilink") and [Portal](Portal "wikilink") spells
it is purely a defensive escape spell and does not allow to travel wider
distances. However, it requires significantly less mana.
