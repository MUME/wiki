title: Drop
---

If you lose interest in a carried item, you can drop it on the ground.
Examples: <nowiki>g

` > drop bottle`
` > drop all          (drops everything you are carrying)`

</pre>

Dropping objects in a certain location in Bree is a good way to get rid
of unwanted things permanently.

You can also use the "drop" command to try and shake off an unwanted
follower: <nowiki>g

` > drop Clint`
` Clint stops following you.`

</pre>
