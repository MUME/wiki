title: Drop
---

If you lose interest in a carried [item](item "wikilink"), you can
**drop** it on the ground. Examples: \> drop bottle \> drop all (drops
everything you are carrying) Dropping objects in a certain location in
[Bree](Bree "wikilink") is a good way to get rid of unwanted things
permanently.

You can also use the "drop" command to try to shake off an unwanted
[follower](follow "wikilink"): \> drop Clint Clint stops following you.

or "drop everyone" to try to shake off everyone:

` > drop everyone`
` Pippin stops following you.`
` Merry stops following you.`
