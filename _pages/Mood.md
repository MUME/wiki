The CHANGE MOOD command enables you to transfer bonus points between
your Offensive bonus and Parrying bonus, thus changing the way you want
to behave in combat, mostly attacking or fighting more carefully.

Possible moods are:

      Berserk                      (special - see below)
      Aggressive
      Brave
      Normal
      Prudent
      Wimpy

If you feel like going berserk, you will not be able to flee anymore,
and if you start a fight in berserk mood, you cannot change mood while
fighting. Also, your wimpy is set to zero in this mood, so remember to
reset it if you change mood later.

If you change mood while fighting, it takes a little while for your
actual mood to change. This is to prevent mood switch spam - you cannot
be aggressive on the moment you deal your blow, and wimpy a fraction of
second later in order to parry the enemy's blow.
