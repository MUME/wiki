[Trolls](Troll "wikilink") can be instantly killed by the sun. Trolls
**sundie**:

- With [link](link "wikilink"), in sunlit areas.
- Without link, in sunlit areas, when affected by
  [Noquit](Noquit "wikilink") or [Novoid](Novoid "wikilink").

Trolls don't sundie:

- Without link, in sunlit areas, when not affected by
  [Noquit](Noquit "wikilink") or [Novoid](Novoid "wikilink").

These deaths are "permanent" and reduce the character to
[level](level "wikilink") one.
