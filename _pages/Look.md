For studying your surroundings or looking at items, creatures etc.

Examples: \>look \>look AT angel \>look IN bag \>look south (or just:
'look s', or even 'l s') \>look 2.map \>look in 2.corpse

Note that if you 'look' at a container you will not see its contents,
but its description.

Important: 'look at [Corpse](Corpse "wikilink")' will not show the
[Inventory](Inventory "wikilink") of the corpse! To see what is inside a
container (e.g. corpse, pouch, ...) use 'examine <container>' or 'look
in <object>'.

"look around" will search your surrounding rooms for light or smoke.
