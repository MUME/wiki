## Bree

In the small area of Bree-Land there are four villages; Archet, Staddle,
Combe and the chief village, Bree. It is the home of both Hobbits and
Humans, who share the community and live peacefully together, the only
place in Middle-Earth where such an arrangement exists. It was in Bree
that the first Hobbits came to the Western part of the World, over the
Misty Mountains. From there in the year 1601 (Third Age), the Shire was
colonised. Nowadays, there is little communication between Bree and the
Shire, the Hobbits of both finding the others strange and foreign. As
well as standing upon the Great Old Road, Bree also stands upon the
ancient North Road, but since the fall of the Northern Kings the road
became desolate, and grass-grown, and the Bree-Landers renamed it the
Greenway.

In MUME, in order to simplify things, the four villages have been
combined into the chief, Bree. Most products can be bought here, and
there are some guilds where simple skills can be learned. The gates of
Bree are closed at night, in order to stop intruders. There is a coach
to Tharbad which is caught near the southwestern end of Bree.

The gatekeepers will open the gates at 7am and close them at 8pm. Should
a citizen wish to leave the town, they may simply ask the gatekeeper to
open it for him. If a citizen should wish to enter Bree at night, he
merely needs to 'call'.
