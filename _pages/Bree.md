In the small area of Bree-Land there are four villages; Archet, Staddle,
Combe and the chief village, **Bree**.

It is the home of both [Hobbits](Hobbit "wikilink") and
[Humans](Human "wikilink"), who share the community and live peacefully
together, the only place in [Middle-Earth](Middle-Earth "wikilink")
where such an arrangement exists.

It was in Bree that the first Hobbits came to the Western part of the
World, over the [Misty Mountains](Misty_Mountains "wikilink"). From
there in the year 1601 ([Third Age](Third_Age "wikilink")), the Shire
was colonised.

Nowadays, there is little communication between Bree and the
[Shire](Shire "wikilink"), the Hobbits of both finding the others
strange and foreign.

As well as standing upon the [Great Old Road](Old_East_Road "wikilink"),
Bree also stands upon the ancient North Road, but since the fall of the
Northern Kings the road became desolate, and grass-grown, and the
Bree-Landers renamed it the [Greenway](Greenway "wikilink").

In MUME, in order to simplify things, the four villages have been
combined into the chief, Bree. Most products can be bought here, and
there are some guilds where simple skills can be learned.

The gates of Bree are closed at night, in order to stop intruders. There
is a [coach](coach "wikilink") to [Tharbad](Tharbad "wikilink") which is
caught near the southwestern end of Bree.

The gatekeepers will open the gates at 7am and close them at 8pm. Should
a citizen wish to leave the town, they may simply ask the gatekeeper to
open it for him. If a citizen should wish to enter Bree at night, he
merely needs to '[call](call "wikilink")'.
