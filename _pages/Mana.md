**Mana** is a character's capability of casting
[spells](spells "wikilink"), represented by a numeric value. High mana
means your character is high on magical power, and low means the
opposite.

By default, your current level of mana is displayed in your prompt. If
nothing is shown, it means your spellcasting capacity is full otherwise,
one of the following words is displayed (in descending order of power):
Burning, Hot, Warm, Cold, Icy, Frozen.

Mana will regenerate at different rates depending on how much you have.
That is to say, it will take a lot longer to regenerate the same amount
of mana if you are at Icy rather than if you were at Hot. Mana
regeneration is faster if you are [resting](rest "wikilink") or
[sleeping](sleep "wikilink").
