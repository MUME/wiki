## Ride

(Ranger Skill)

Use 'ride' to ride on a mobile. Use 'dismount' or 'lead' to get off the
mount.

Only certain mobiles may be ridden (such as horses), and very strong
players! Very short people trying to ride animals much larger and
heavier than themselves will have some trouble controlling their mounts.

If you type 'ride' without any commands, you will try to ride any
previously ridden mounts in the area you are in.

You will only be able to control a horse if you are the first one to
ride it. To ride with a certain person on his mount, you can use 'ride
behind <person>'.

You may not be able to ride in certain outdoor areas, and certain indoor
areas may allow riding. You will have to learn these areas as they
appear. Riding a horse is a little tiring.

While riding, you will realize if your mount is becoming tired (in your
prompt). Expert riders can also do this by looking at a mount, even if
they are not riding it.

NOTE: If the controller of the horse is not in combat and neither is the
horse, the controller may encourage the horse to ride on, even if there
are other players on the horse who are fighting.

Example:
