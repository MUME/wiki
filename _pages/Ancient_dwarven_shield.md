## Statistics

Standing more than three feet high, this shield is large enough to
provide
cover for even the tallest of Dwarves. The shield is constructed from
dark,
silvery metal making it heavy and yet it remains well balanced. On the
face
of the shield, the raised image of a battle axe crossed with a forging
hammer
has been skilfully hammered out. Around the edges are the magical runes
used
in the creation of the shield.

## Opinions

Equal highest [parry bonus](parry_bonus "wikilink") (35) shield along
with the [tower shield](A_tower_shield "wikilink"), an [Ancient dwarven
shield](An_ancient_dwarven_shield "wikilink") is only really a serious
choice for a warrior - preferably one with max strength and some means
of bonus strength (either [spell](Strength_spell "wikilink") or
[ring](Jewelledring "wikilink")). Although it is almost no different to
a [tower shield](A_tower_shield "wikilink"), the [Ancient dwarven
shield](An_ancient_dwarven_shield "wikilink") is highly difficult to
get. Despite being very heavy, it's weight is somewhat cancelled out by
the lightweight propertires of other equipment that loads alongside it.
This is certainly a powerful shield, but it becomes even more so in it's
corrupted form: a [Defiled Dwarven
Shield](A_defiled_dwarven_shield "wikilink").
