title: Ancient dwarven shield
---

\> **examine shield**
Standing more than three feet high, this shield is large enough to
provide
cover for even the tallest of Dwarves. The shield is constructed from
dark,
silvery metal making it heavy and yet it remains well balanced. On the
face
of the shield, the raised image of a battle axe crossed with a forging
hammer
has been skilfully hammered out. Around the edges are the magical runes
used
in the creation of the shield.
\> **consider shield**
It is an ancient dwarven shield.
It weighs two stone and eleven pounds.
It fits you well.

Equal highest [parry bonus](parry_bonus "wikilink") (35) shield along
with the [tower shield](tower_shield "wikilink"), an ancient dwarven
shield is only really a serious choice for a
[warrior](warrior "wikilink") - preferably one with max
[strength](strength "wikilink") and some means of bonus strength (either
[spell](Strength_spell "wikilink") or [ring](jewelled_ring "wikilink")).
Although it is almost no different to a tower shield, the ancient
dwarven shield is highly difficult to get. Despite being very heavy,
it's weight is somewhat cancelled out by the lightweight properties of
other equipment that loads alongside it. This is certainly a powerful
shield, but it becomes even more so in it's corrupted form: a [defiled
dwarven shield](defiled_dwarven_shield "wikilink")
