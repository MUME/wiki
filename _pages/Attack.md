**Attack** is a [thief](thief "wikilink") [skill](skill "wikilink") that
allows you to hit twice in a combat round, if you wield a suitable
([piercing](piercing "wikilink")) weapon. It also speeds up your
[fleeing](flee "wikilink") attempts independently of what weapon you are
wielding.

Note that whilst most skills decay with disuse, the attack skill is less
apt to do so, as it is something of a measure of agility, and is used
not only in conjunction with the piercing skill, but also every time you
are forced to flee from combat.
