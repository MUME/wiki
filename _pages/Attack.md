## Attack

(Thief Skill)

Allows you to hit twice in a combat round, if you wield a suitable
(piercing) weapon. Speeds up your fleeing attempts independently of what
weapon you are wielding.

Note that whilst most skills decay with disuse, the attack skill is less
apt to do so, as it is something of a measure of agility, and is used
not only in conjunction with the piercing skill, but also every time you
are forced to flee from combat.
