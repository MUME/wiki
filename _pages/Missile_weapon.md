**[Missile weapons](Missile "wikilink")** are one of the
[weapon](weapon "wikilink") types found in [MUME](MUME "wikilink"). Many
missile weapons inflict considerable amounts of damage, while requiring
little [strength](strength "wikilink") to wield. Thus these weapons are
mostly used by [thieves](thief "wikilink"), but are viable for other
light classes, such as [clerics](cleric "wikilink"). While powerful,
using them is more complicated than other weapon types, as they require
their users to have appropriate [missiles](ammunition "wikilink") on
hand.

## Longbows

These bows take longer to fire, but inflict more damage. This makes them
ideal for attacking a target that is engaged with another character, as
you cannot be interrupted, but you get more damage out of each arrow.

- [embellished longbow](embellished_longbow "wikilink") - A very
  powerful longbow.
- [yew longbow](yew_longbow "wikilink") - A powerful longbow.
- [longbow](longbow "wikilink") - A weak longbow.

## Shortbows

These bows fire faster, but inflict less damage than longbows or
crossbows. This makes them ideal for attacking a target that is engaged
with you, as you will be able to fire more arrows without being
interrupted. They are also used frequently to disrupt other player's

- [black horn shortbow](black_horn_shortbow "wikilink") - a very fast
  shooting bow.
- [orkish shortbow](orkish_shortbow "wikilink") - a fast shooting bow.
- [elven shortbow](elven_shortbow "wikilink") - a fast shooting bow.
- [shortbow](shortbow "wikilink") - a fast shooting, weak bow.

## Crossbows

Crossbows shoot slowly, but inflict a good amount of damage. They are
also effective against armoured opponents. They also have the benefit of
being loaded before being shot. You can load a crossbow, and as long as
you do not remove it it will remain loaded. A loaded crossbow shot
cannot be interrupted, and fires very quickly.

- [crossbow](crossbow "wikilink") - a powerful crossbow.
- [light crossbow](light_crossbow "wikilink") - a less powerful
  crossbow.

## Sling

Slings are a weak missile weapon. They inflict little damage and have
poor accuracy, but their speed is fast. They see little use, but they
have one benefit; you can find more sling stones just by searching for
them in proper areas.

- [sling](sling "wikilink") - the only sling weapon
