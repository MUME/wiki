\> **look thorn**

The thorn is very much like the thorn of a rose, with only a slight
difference

in size: it is big as a short sword and, in fact, feels quite
comfortable in

one's hand. Its point is immensely sharp, and a green liquid slowly
drips from

it. Since it is not made of iron, it is also rustproof.

\> **consider thorn**

It is a sharp thorn.

This piercing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is poor while attacking and good while defending; its speed is very
fast, and it inflicts little damage upon hitting.

It weighs about one pound.
