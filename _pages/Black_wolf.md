Slightly larger than its grey-furred cousin, the black wolf nevertheless
shares
many of the same traits such as hunting habits. Its howl is deeper than
its
cousin's which is normally good warning to leave the area before
nightfall. At
this time, it becomes the expert at stealth as its dark fur and
red-black eyes
make it very hard to spot prior to being attacked.
