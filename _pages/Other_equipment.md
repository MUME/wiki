# Cloaks

Good choices for worn about body are: forest green cloak or russet cloak
(decent db, speeds up moveregen), roughly stitched cloak (not as much
moveregen as fgc but more db), fine grey cloak (most db but slows down
hp regen a tiny bit), black hooded cloak (evil version of finegrey,
makes spells hurt a bit more instead), sacred cloak (for battling
spirits) for defensive and cavebear fur or black warg fur (lighter) for
ob. Beorn fur is best for ob but rare. But dont forget that brown bear
fur and black bear fur also add 2 ob as well. So for you lowbies that
cant attain a cave bear fur or black warg fur you can get these easier.
