title: Quest
---

Several [mobiles](mobile "wikilink") on [MUME](MUME "wikilink") offer
**quests** of varying levels to be solved. This can range from killing a
certain monster, delivering a rare item to repairing something. As a
reward, sometimes a [herblore](herblore "wikilink") will be offered, a
rare item or a (temporary) skill boost.

These quests are usually offered, although in some cases you will need
to ask them about something specific.

## Lowbie

### The Hunt

A trapper northwest of [Forlond](Forlond "wikilink") mentioned an old
tale of a legendary stag. Perhaps you could hear out his story before
attempting to find it yourself?

- Quest: Prove to the elven trapper you are a worthy hunter by selling
  furs and pelts from animals you've killed and butchered. Listen to him
  talk about old times, and about a [noble stag](noble_stag "wikilink")
  he recently sighted to the northwest, then nod in agreement when he
  asks you to kill the noble stag and give him its
  [antlers](a_pair_of_antlers "wikilink"). If the trapper does not start
  talking after you've sold the furs and pelts, then either you have not
  sold him enough, or the noble stag is not loading at the moment, in
  which case, wait a while before trying again. Once you find the noble
  stag get it killed and butcher it to produce the antlers. This quest
  can be done twice by the same character, but the second time requires
  more furs/pelts, and they must be given to the trapper, not sold for
  money.
- Reward: [Yew longbow](a_yew_longbow "wikilink"), and quiver with 12
  [ash arrows](an_ash_arrow "wikilink").

### The Lonely Giant

It's nice to know how to cook delicious bannocks. They are one of the
most nutritious foods in arda, but unlike the legendary elven lembas
wafers, you can make bannocks yourself... that is, if you complete this
quest.

- Location: Various locations in the [Shire](Shire "wikilink").
- Quest: Find the [lonely giant](lonely_giant "wikilink") and comfort
  the poor fellow. He'll then offer to teach you how to make bannocks of
  golden brown, but to do this, he needs you to bring him some
  [herbs](herb "wikilink"). You have about 1.5 MUME days to complete the
  quest (36 minutes), or else you must start over. Just like Nordri
  quest, if you forget which items you still need to bring, you can
  simply ask giant items.
- Reward: Baker herblore, 1000 exp.

### [Aldereon](Aldereon "wikilink") the Wise

This old and wise Elf lives east of the [Grey
Havens](Grey_Havens "wikilink"). He has quite a wide correspondence
network and is usually in need of aid for delivering letters.

- Location: Elven village north of the Road to Grey Havens, just west of
  Greenholm junction.
- Quest: Aldereon will ask you to deliver letters to his friends. The
  number of letters you will have to deliver varies by level - around 5
  for level 1 to more than 15 for high legend. The higher your level is,
  the farther away you will have to travel to meet the mobs.
- Reward: Walking [herblore](herblore "wikilink"), 200 exp per your
  level for each mail.

### Nordri the Shopkeeper

This [Dwarf](Dwarf "wikilink") is located on the upper level of the
Dwarven mines. As a shopkeeper, he usually has need of a few items. Of
course, one hand washes the other, eh?

- Location: Upper level of the [Blue
  Mountains](Blue_Mountains "wikilink") dwarven city.
- Quest: This is a "Find and bring" quest. To start the quest, ask
  Nordri about herblore. He will then speak to you about the value of
  the dwarven lore, and how if you want him to help you, you must first
  help him. When he states there is a price to learn the herblore, you
  must then ask him price. Nordri will tell you what the price is, to
  which you nod to agree to the deal. Then find and deliver the items he
  requests. If you ever forget what items he wants, simply ask him
  'items'.
- Reward: soothing-draught herblore, 300 exp per your level for each
  item.

### Vig the Smelter

Young Dwarves might stumble upon Vig when visiting the lower levels of
the Dwarven mines. If you smelt, you usually need wood...

- Location: Bottom-most level of dwarven city, all west from shops, but
  still east of guilds on middle level.
- Quest: Vig the Smelter sometimes runs out of logs for his fire. When
  he does, he will ask people who come into his shop if they're willing
  to go out and get him some wood. If you agree to help him, get an axe,
  preferably a woodsman's axe, and go hunting for the majestic tree.
  Once you find it, wield your axe and either "chop tree" or "cut tree".
  Take the wood from the tree back to Vig, and collect your reward.

<!-- -->

- - Just a small warning: there is a dense forest east of the city that
    is a maze, (if you go east then west, there's no guarantee that
    you'll return to from where you came). If you need to get out of it
    in a hurry, go north and west until you eventually find the room
    with the boat and shrub, then head east to to the trail.

- Reward: 15 silver, ??? exp.

### Shopkeeper's daughter

- Quest: If you're below level 5, the hobbit shopkeeper of Hobbiton will
  ask you to find his lost daughter as soon as you enter his shop. Agree
  to the task, then search the Shire for her. She is unique from all the
  other hobbits in the Shire in that as soon as you enter her room,
  she'll exclaim for help, and start following you. Lead her to her
  father.

### Hrivesur's Key

You will need the unworked piece of mithral from Moria to complete this
quest. You will also need a silver-leaf brooch. You may want to get them
before you start this quest as there is a running clock. Also note that
moonlight is required in order to open the dwarven tomb at the end of
the quest. So you will want to wait to attempt this quest if there is no
visible moon in the current time of year. You may also want a char with
control weather since it is often stormy on the gulf of Lhun.

WARNING: The dwarven tomb is VERY hard. Multiple whole groups have gone
in and mob-ripped without being able to recover their equipment. Proceed
carefully and at your own risk.

- Location:

To start this quest find Hrivesur the Sinda in the GH zones SW of
Harlond. Hrivesur is in a room behind a locked exit up.

- Quest:

Say hello to him. He will talk to you a bit and tell you to ask his
brother about Doriath.

Go ask his brother. His brother is the chieftain of the village to the
south east. His brother will talk to you a bit but tell you to bring you
a silver-leaf brooch before he finishes his story. To get the brooch you
need to retrieve the OIE book for Elrond without reading it.

The chieftain will then send you back to Hrivesur. Ask Hrivesur
"dwarves". Hrivesur will tell you a long story about dwarven refugees
and a key he is keeping for their heirs. He will ask if you want it. If
you say yes, he will ask you for a piece of mithral for Moria. Once you
give it to him, he will give you the dark, silvery stone.

- Loot

A dark, silvery stone. It is a key to the dwarven tombs at the eroded
peak along the eastern edge of this zone. I don't know exactly what you
may find if you survive the perils of the tomb. But I've heard talk of a
mysterious and powerful relic of Beleriand, Nimphelos.
