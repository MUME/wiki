## Quests

Several mobiles on MUME offer quests of varying levels to be solved.
This can range from killing a certain monster, delivering a rare item to
repairing something. As a reward, sometimes a herblore will be offered,
a rare item or a (temporary) skill boost.

These quests are usually offered, although in some cases you will need
to ask them about something specific.
