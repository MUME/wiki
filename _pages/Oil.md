**Oil** is used as fuel for [lanterns](lantern "wikilink"). Oil is
commonly found in the [dark coloured
flasks](dark_coloured_flask "wikilink") sold by most grocers, but can
also be stored in other [containers](container "wikilink"). One can also
[drink](drink "wikilink") oil, though that is not very wise, as unlike
most liquids oil does not quench thirst at all (and probably doesn't
taste very good!).
