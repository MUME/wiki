title: Fine soft leather boots
---

\> **look boots**

These calf-high clodhoppers are constructed from thick brown leather,
with a

rather fetching fur lining around the top. Thanks to a sheepskin lining,
they

also keep your feet nice and warm during those long winter walks.

\> **consider boots**

They are a fine pair of soft leather boots.

They weigh a couple of pounds.
