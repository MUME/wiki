\> **look boots**
These calf-high clodhoppers are constructed from thick brown leather,
with a
rather fetching fur lining around the top. Thanks to a sheepskin lining,
they
also keep your feet nice and warm during those long winter walks.
\> **consider boots**
They are a fine pair of soft leather boots.
They weigh a couple of pounds.
