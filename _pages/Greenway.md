The Greenway is what remains of the old North-South road that originally
connected [Arnor](Arnor "wikilink") and [Gondor](Gondor "wikilink"). It
runs between [Tharbad](Tharbad "wikilink") and
[Fornost](Fornost "wikilink"), crossing the [Old East
Road](Old_East_Road "wikilink") just west of [Bree](Bree "wikilink"). It
is named for the grass which now covers its little-travelled tracks.
