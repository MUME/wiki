title: "Warrior"

Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player. This
makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills of
violence and fighting unequalled by the members of any other class.
However, they are poor at all sorts of magic, and if they learn spells,
will never be able to cast them as efficiently as a real spellcaster.
