title: Warrior
---

**Warriors** are known to have more strength than the average player.
This makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills of
violence and fighting unequalled by the members of any other
[class](class "wikilink"). However, they are poor at all sorts of magic,
and if they learn [spells](spell "wikilink"), will never be able to cast
them as efficiently as a real spellcaster.

### Opinion

The warrior class is the most popular class in the game. It is also the
best class to start off playing as a newbie.
