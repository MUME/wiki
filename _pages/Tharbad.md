title: Tharbad
---

The once lawful city of **Tharbad** has long since been abandoned to
civilised use. Lying far south from [Bree](Bree "wikilink"), along the
North-South road; which the Bree-Landers call the
[Greenway](Greenway "wikilink"), the city welcomes few past its gates.

Rumour has it that there was a coup d'etat in Tharbad, and a more
ruthless and merciless [Chief](Chief_of_Tharbad "wikilink") has taken
power in that city of thieves.

His decree follows:

1\. If you wish to live in Tharbad you may [register as a
citizen](citizenship "wikilink"), upon payment of a small contribution.
The secretary will calculate the amount when you ask him. Be aware that
he is accompanied by guards who may still be impolite to you.

2\. The gates of Tharbad will henceforth be opened in the day and closed
at nightfall. Hours may be adjusted.

No human or beast will be admitted in the closed hours.

(Sidenote: The gatekeeper has carelessly dropped the hint that he is
rather low on funds. It is likely he will accept monetary gifts gladly.
When you are stopped by the locked gate at night,
"[call](call "wikilink")" and then "[bribe x gold](bribe "wikilink")".
He may just be persuaded to open for your group.)

Know however that these are but rumours.

## Justice

- Orcs and Trolls are wanted by default
- Other citizens and non-citizens are only wanted after committing a
  crime
- Wielding weapons or casting is fine regardless of citizenship
- Attacking a non citizen is fine, attacking a citizen not
- There are various mobs (like assassins) who are not counted as citizen

If you get wanted it's time to fight and/or run rather than to
surrender. Tharbad's justice system is known to show little lenience.
