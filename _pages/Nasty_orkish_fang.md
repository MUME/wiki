title: Nasty orkish fang
---

\> **examine fang**

It is a three foot long, thin, single edged, sharp blade, with the shape
of

a huge fang. A small white skull is engraved on its handle. It is a
crude

weapon with no aesthetics, as all orkish weapons are, but it looks quite

effective.

\> **consider fang**

This piercing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is awful while attacking and average while defending; its speed is
very fast, and it inflicts average damage upon hitting.

It weighs a couple of pounds.
