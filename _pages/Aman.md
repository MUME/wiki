Aman ("Blessed Realm" or "Free from Evil" in Quenya, pron. \[ˈaman\]) is
a continent that lies to the west of Middle-earth, across the great
ocean Belegaer. It is the home of the Valar, and three kindreds of
Elves: the Vanyar, some of the Noldor, and some of the Teleri. The
island of Tol Eressëa lies just off the eastern shore.

Upon the destruction of Almaren in very ancient times, the Valar fled to
Aman, and there established the realm of Valinor.
