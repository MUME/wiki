**Old Man Willow** is a tree-beast, either an ent or a huorn, whose
heart has turned black with evil. He lives in the [Old
Forest](Old_Forest "wikilink") and is known to sing walking creatures to
sleep so that he can then kill them.

Willow is very powerful, but drops the [Blue
Crystal](Blue_Crystal "wikilink") that is sought by
[Heroes](Hero "wikilink").
