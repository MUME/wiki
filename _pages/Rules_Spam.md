Spamming is an abuse of communication commands since it fills other
people's terminals with garbage. A typical example is repeating the same
narrate fifty times in a row, or dropping 500 piles of coins in a room,
or narrating/singing "last narrate" just before a reboot.

Thus: Let it be known that commands like '#100 close door' or '#12345
sing' are NOT tolerated on Mume.

Why? a) Unfair for those who have no client b) generates Spam and Mume
CPU usage.

Demotions will cool down the abusers.
