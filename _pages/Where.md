The **where** command is really two commands.

Typing 'where' without an argument lists the players potentially visible
to you in your current zone. (A zone is a 10\*10 [room](room "wikilink")
area.) This list will not include players of the opposite side in the
war ([elves](elf "wikilink") will not see where [orcs](orc "wikilink")
are). Those players who are [hidden](hide "wikilink") or successfully
[sneaking](sneak "wikilink") are not shown on the where list.

Typing 'where <target>' produces a variant of
'[track](track "wikilink")'. You look for tracks of your target passing
through the room you are in, but if you find tracks you will not keep
looking for tracks as you move (as opposed to 'track').

Characters who chose to toggle '[incognito](incognito "wikilink") where'
on are also not shown.
