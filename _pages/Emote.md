title: Emote
permalink: /Emote/
---

This command is used to show emotions or actions. For example, if Bilbo
types:

\>emote lets heavy tears roll down his cheek and fall down onto the
floor.

The room would see: Bilbo lets heavy tears roll down his cheek and fall
down onto the floor.

You can use , (comma) as an abbreviation for emote. If the line to be
emoted starts with an ' there will be no space between the name of the
character and the line. For example:

\>emote 's eyes grow wet with tears.

would produce:

Bilbo's eyes grow wet with tears. Also, you can use a % to specify a
creature in the room. For example:

\>emote smiles warmly at %frodo.

would produce:

<to the room> Bilbo smiles warmly at Frodo. <to Frodo> Bilbo smiles
warmly at you.

If you write 's after the name in a %-construction, you get a possessive
form of the command. For example:

\>emote looks at %gandalf's staff.

would produce:

<to the room> Bilbo looks at Gandalf's staff. <to Gandalf> Bilbo looks
at your staff.

There is a collection of canned emotes, social commands, if you don't
want to type your own. Abuse of emote to show misleading information
(such as 'emote slashes your head and shatters it!') can lead to
punishment.
