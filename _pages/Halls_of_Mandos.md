The **Halls of Mandos** is a special [room](room "wikilink") where all
newly created whitie characters start out, and also where all whitie
characters end up after [dying](death "wikilink") or
[unretiring](retire "wikilink"). In the Halls, the
[pray](pray "wikilink") command works differently - instead of
communicating with the [Ainur](Ainur "wikilink"), it instead allows you
to transport to a selected location on [Arda](Arda "wikilink") (see the
[pray](pray "wikilink") article for more info). If you were sent to the
Halls after dying, you need to regenerate some
[health](hit_points "wikilink") before you can pray. It's impossible to
[narrate](narrate "wikilink"), [sing](sing "wikilink") or cast
[spells](spell "wikilink") while in the Halls.

The room contains a sign and a bulletin [board](board "wikilink") that
provide some info for new players. Some basic equipment also loads here
on a table, including a [hatchet](hatchet "wikilink"), a [hunting
knife](hunting_knife "wikilink"), [torches](torch "wikilink"), and some
food like [apples](apple "wikilink") and
[bread](loaf_of_bread "wikilink").
