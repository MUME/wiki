In general, **reimbursements** are not given on [MUME](MUME "wikilink").
The only case in which you will get one is when you died due to a
reproducible bug.

Reimbursements are never given for the following things:

- Lagdeaths, both due to the net and due to MUME.
- Loss of [equipment](equipment "wikilink") or
  [experience](experience "wikilink") due to a crash.
- Reconnecting in a deadly place after losing [link](link "wikilink").
- Following another player in a deadly situation.
- Death due to [pkilling](PK "wikilink") (unless the killer was
  violating pkilling rules).
- Loss of [artifacts](artifact "wikilink"), for any reason.
- Loss of equipment to [rent](rent "wikilink") confiscation for whatever
  reason.

Policy](Rules_Reimbursement_Policy "wikilink") for examples.
