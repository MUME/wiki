In general, reimbursements are not given on MUME. The only case in which
you will get one is when you died due to a reproducible bug.

Reimbursements are never given for the following things:

\- Lagdeaths, both due to the net and due to MUME. - Loss of equipment
or experience due to a crash. - Reconnecting in a deadly place after
losing link. - Following another player in a deadly situation. - Death
due to pkilling (unless the killer was violating pkilling rules). - Loss
of artifacts, for any reason. - Loss of equipment to rent confiscation
for whatever reason.
