title: Practice Penalty
---

Practicing skills from classes outside your main class will result in a
diminished efficiency of your main class skills. For instance, a Thief
that practices [Cleric](Cleric "wikilink") or [Mage](Mage "wikilink")
[Spells](Spells "wikilink") will find that he will fail more backstabs
than usual. It is commonly believed the biggest practice penalties are
caused by a cleric crosspracticing as a scout or vice versa, and a
warrior crosspracticing as a mage or vice versa.
