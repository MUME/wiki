It is possible to become **diseased** on Mume, either with a sickness
(plague, cold, etc...) or by a [poison](poison "wikilink") (poison,
venom, etc...). A disease will typically reduce your
[strength](strength "wikilink") and
[constitution](constitution "wikilink"), or your
[regeneration](regeneration "wikilink") rate.

After the sickness has passed away, you will be immune for a long while.
The [Heal](Heal "wikilink") [spell](spell "wikilink") will remove a
sickness, but if you are healed, you will not be immune towards it
afterwards.

It is also possible to get poisoned, mostly by nasty monsters like
spiders and snakes. The players can also [poison](envenom "wikilink")
their blade once they know how to produce a vial of poison. As for the
sicknesses, there are many poisons with different effects. The [Remove
Poison](Remove_Poison "wikilink") spell will lower the effect of the
poison and generally cure it after one or several tries.

Another way to be cured from many sicknesses and diseases is to drink an
[antidote](antidote "wikilink"), which can be found or produced by those
who know the [herblores](herblore "wikilink").

Some [races](races "wikilink") are more resistant towards some diseases.
[Elves](Elf "wikilink"), for example, never get Flu,
[orcs](orc "wikilink") are very resistant to many diseases, and
[trolls](troll "wikilink") have a thick stony dead skin which protects
them against the poisoned blades.
