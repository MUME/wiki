title: Backstab
---

**Backstabbing** is a [thief](thief "wikilink")
[skill](skill "wikilink") that allows you to place your dagger in your
opponent's back at the precise point at which it will cause the most
harm. A successful backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on
level. Note that you must be [sneaking](sneak "wikilink") successfully
or be [hidden](hide "wikilink") from your opponent and you must be
wielding an appropriate [piercing weapon](piercing_weapon "wikilink").

The act of stabbing someone in the back will be carried out in the
aggressive [mood](mood "wikilink"), but afterwards you will return to
your previous fighting mood.

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab and sneak at your [guild](guild "wikilink").
Note also that it is easier to backstab a victim in certain types of
[terrain](terrain "wikilink") (eg. forests) than others, and harder to
backstab someone who has high perception. You can backstab
[sleeping](Sleep "wikilink") or [blind](Blindness "wikilink") persons
with a higher chance of success, even if you are not hiding or sneaking.

If you try and backstab someone who can see you, you will get a nasty
surprise.

Example:
