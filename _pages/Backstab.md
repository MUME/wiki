## Backstab

Backstabbing a victim is a way to place your dagger in your opponents
back at the precise point at which it will cause the most harm. A
successful backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level. Note
that you must be sneaking successfully or be hidden from your opponent
and you must be wielding an appropriate piercing weapon.

The act of stabbing someone in the back will be carried out in the
aggressive mood, but afterwards you will return to your previous
fighting mood.

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well you
have practiced backstab and sneak, at your guild. Note also that it is
easier to backstab a victim in certain types of terrain (eg. forests)
than others, and harder to backstab someone who has high perception. You
can backstab sleeping or blind persons with a higher chance of success,
even if you are not hiding or sneaking.

If you try and backstab someone who can see you, you will get a nasty
surprise.

Example:
