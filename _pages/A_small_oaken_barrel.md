title: A small oaken barrel
---

\> **examine barrel**

The fine grain of the aged oak that composes this barrel as well as the
skill

shown in its forged iron bounds make it clear that its contents must be
quite

valuable. Its size is relatively small however, not longer than twenty
inches

or wider than a foot. As the aperture in one of its panels has been
carefully

sealed, there is no hint at what kind of liquid nearly fills it. On one
side,

a partly erased mark can be made out.

\> **consider barrel**

It is a small oaken barrel.

It weighs six stone.
