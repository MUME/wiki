\> A wild dog bares his yellow fangs at you.
\> **look dog**
Snarling fiercely at you, this sinewy dog is one of the few survivors of
the
Great Plague of 1636, sweeping from the East-lands of Middle Earth to
Eriador
and the Shire. Adapting to the harshness, these beasts have mastered the
skills
of stealth and scavenging. His smoke black eyes stare chillingly at
you.
