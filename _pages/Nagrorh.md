<nowiki>g Gaunt and skeletal in form. Nagrorh's eye sockets are black
and empty save for the fierce pinpoints of light which serve him as
eyes. Garbed in rich clothes of nobility, an aura of cold and darkness
radiates from him, an ominous and fearsome sight. The magic contained in
him overwhelms everything... Nagrorh is in an excellent condition.
Nagrorh is using: <wielded> a mace <held> a black bone key
<worn on body> an enruned robe (satisfactory)
