**Nagrorh** is a necromancer that lives near
[Greenholm](Greenholm "wikilink"). He's an aggressive level ?
[mob](mob "wikilink"). He can cast [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") and
[Lightning Bolt](Lightning_Bolt "wikilink") as well as a spell that
summons [spectres](spectre "wikilink") to defend him. He
[tracks](track "wikilink") within his two rooms, and any summoned
spectres will [follow](follow "wikilink") him. He loads 5
[gold](gold "wikilink"), an [enruned robe](enruned_robe "wikilink"), a
[mace](mace "wikilink") and the [black bone
key](black_bone_key "wikilink") that unlocks the door south of the
[room](room "wikilink") where he spawns. The room contains a chest with
either a [broadsword](broadsword "wikilink") or [large metal full
shield](large_metal_full_shield "wikilink") in it.

`Nagrorh the Abomination is looking at you with flaming red eyes.`
`>`**`examine Nagrorh`**
`Gaunt and skeletal in form. Nagrorh's eye sockets are black and empty save for`
`the fierce pinpoints of light which serve him as eyes.  Garbed in rich clothes`
`of nobility, an aura of cold and darkness radiates from him, an ominous and`
`fearsome sight. The magic contained in him overwhelms everything...`

## Strategy

He can be dealt with pretty easily by a [hero](hero "wikilink")+
[thief](thief "wikilink") - simply
[backstab](backstab "wikilink")/[escape](escape "wikilink") until he's
dead. A tip - if he casts sanc when you enter his room, but doesn't
immediately attack, just go west (he doesn't track if you haven't
engaged him in combat) and wait out the sanc - makes killing him a lot
faster, as he doesn't re-sanc often.
