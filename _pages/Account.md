Players should have one master ACCOUNT, when logging into mume you can
choose to login into a specific CHARACTER or your master account that
allows you to see info on all the characters you own.

Some frequently asked questions ( Assume that you have the account
"Martin" and the characters "Frodo" and "Bilbo")

<nowiki>g Q: How do I get to the account menu?

A: Log in with your ACCOUNT name (ie in this case Martin) instead of a
character name.

Q: How to add characters to my account?

A: use the ADD command in the account menu. (example: add frodo)

Q: How to change the account password?

A: Use the PASS command from the account menu.

Q: How to make a new character?

A: Use the CREATE command from the account menu. (example: create Bilbo)

Q: Is it possible to log in characters and type only ONE password?

A: Yes, change your character password to nothing, and you will only be
asked for account password on login. (To do this: While logged in with
your char, type "change password", and hit enter twice when asked for
new password)

Q: How do I play my character directly, without logging on the account?

A: If your character name is different from the account name, as we
recommend, just type the character name and account password (and
possibly character password). If your character and account have the
same name, you can prepend a ! to the name. (example: !martin)
