You can set fire to a corpse or corpses by using the command 'burn'. The
corpses will be destroyed in the process and the equipment they contain
will be lost. If there are many corpses in the room and you try to burn
them all, all will be piled together before you start the bonfire... It
is rumoured that searching among the ashes of a funeral pyre can yield
some remains of the possessions of the burnt corpse.

During the fire the room will be lit and warm.

When you set fire, a message is seen in the adjacent rooms, like when a
campfire is made.

Example:

` > burn corpse`
` > burn 2.corpse`
` > burn all.corpse`
