## Troll fundamentals

### Subraces

- **Mountain** trolls
  - Mountain trolls are highly efficient with **battle rams**, moving
    them with increased speed and reduced move cost.
  - Mountain Trolls will sometimes hit nearby targets with **wild
    attacks** when engaged in combat.
    - Wild swings work when blinded with reduced OB([News
      2703](https://mume.org/news/game/2703.php))
    - Taara: "Have so far seen it hit 4 enemies at the same time and it
      can happen multiple times in a single engagement."
    - Zorts: "I've noticed that DB affects swings more."
    - Baca: "Mountain troll wild swing linked to Dex stat."
  - Mountain Trolls can **shake trees, push boulders, drag corpses, open
    doors, and dig with increased speed and reduced move cost**.
- **Cave** trolls
  - Cave trolls have slightly **increased hit point regeneration**. This
    bonus is increased when in a cave or tunnel.
    - Belond: "I tested with a level 1 cave/hill troll with same stats
      and timed HP regen in warrens from 20HP to 123 a couple of times.
      It took around 170s for cave and 198s for hill trolls, roughly a
      15% difference."
    - Knack/Icetee: "We tested and campfire and Cavetroll Bonus HP regen
      stack"
  - Cave Trolls have **huge bashes** which may cause the victim to
    hurtle and collide with a nearby engaged target.
    - Baca: "The "double bash" doesn't land all that often. Went with
      max troll dex and 90% unarmed on hero troll. Double bash linked to
      Dex stat."
- **Hill** trolls
  - Hill trolls deal **extra damage to stunned opponents when wielding a
    concussion weapon**.
    - Knack: "Even with the bash bonus on „normal“ mobs concussion
      didn’t reach the unarmed damage. I’m not sure vs full metal
      enemies. I was wielding ornate."
    - Finwë: "The bonus does apply for 1 handed and 2 handed concussion
      weapons"
  - Hill trolls enjoy **storming into battle and get a higher offensive
    bonus when aggressive or berserk**.([News
    2703](https://mume.org/news/game/2703.php))
  - A rather grimy hill troll has taken up residence in the Warrens.
    Rumour has it that he might be willing to **teach other hill trolls
    a new ability**-- for a price.([News
    2695](https://mume.org/news/game/2695.php))
    - Knack: "The burrow mechanic is funny but not more - exit to hole
      can be hidden but it’s always the same exit name. Burrowed hole is
      noride. Can’t burrow in indoor rooms"
    - Lingura: "Can't dig in non-hill room, can't even dig in all hill
      rooms. Can't connect burrow to tunnels made with the Shovel. Can
      fail with no apparent reason so unreliable if you need emergency
      burrow before sun-up. Breakable door, single room and sunny hills,
      make it very risky to use during day."
    - Baca: If you use the command dig burrow, it digs at "normal" speed
      and the exit down has a closeable door. If you burrow quickly, the
      exit down digs about twice as fast, but it is an open exit with no
      door. Digging takes just a few moves to perform.

### Height & Weight

- Troll subraces have different heights and weights as of 03.03.23
  (Source:
  [Jahara](http://elvenrunes.com/cgi-bin/logs/show.m?log=b65607,69235&disc=1&sort=1&snew=1&omode=&all=0&typ=))
  - Jahara: Mountain: tallest, Cave: heaviest, Hill: smallest (Source:
    [1](https://discord.com/channels/497457567392333824/1053892480061419560/1359206433383776267))
- Max height troll is 9ft (By Enforcer, sample size 200 characters).
- Height/Weight matters because different EQ that drops fits different
  height/weight, trolls can't resize equipment.
  - As Dol Guldur citizen, a troll can mend equipment, but not resize
    it. Troll can't mend shining chains/metals.
    - For Dol Guldur citizenship, need to kill Druidess that loads a
      phial, then deliver to Adragor.
  - Trolls can also mend metals with a cross-pein hammer (loads in OIE,
    need amethyst to get, amethyst loads on Cinard)
- For spears you get a bonus chance for keep-at-bay effect if your spear
  is longer than opponent's spear
  ([Stabbing](https://mume.org/help/stabbing)).
  - To know the length of spears, "look spear"
  - If both spears have the same length, then the taller character has a
    higher chance to keep-at-bay. So it is still useful to have a tall
    troll. So if you really want to minmax your character, create like
    10 characters and in account screen type "info xxx" for each
    character and see which one is tallest.(from Elestir)
- To minmax troll moves, avoid terrain with Shallows and Hills
  [Terrain](https://mume.org/help/terrain)

### Troll Stats - Rules of Thumb

- Any CON above 20 does not improve Endurance%. CON 20 WIL 15 is max
  endurance 114%. In other words: CON 20 WIL 13 has same endurance % as
  CON 22 WIL 13.
  - Level 32 troll can max endurance.
- Any STR above 20 does not improve Unarmed%. STR 20 DEX 15 WIL 15 is
  max unarmed 104%. In other words: STR 20 DEX 13 WIL 13 has same
  unarmed % as STR 25 DEX 13 WIL 13. ([Vurv Unarmed %
  Test](http://www.elvenrunes.de/cgi-bin/logs/secure/show.m?log=b65607,69235&disc=1&sort=1&snew=1&omode=&all=&typ=))
- You want to hit STR 25 in some way: either base 25 or training to 25
  because each 1 STR increases unarmed damage 5%. You want to reach STR
  28 with age and str-ring.
  - STR also helps with: better moves due to more encumbrance, door
    bashing
- Unarmed is the king - it used to be weak because trolls got enough OB
  for unarmed at lvl 50. But now with level changes, trolls benefited
  the most, so even lvl 25 troll has enough OB for unarmed. Unarmed does
  more damage compared to any weapon, like war mattock against metal
  kind of damage.
- Noone has proved that higher unarmed % does more damage. It seems
  higher unarmed % only increases OB but this might be wrong. This is
  pretty worthless test because of low sample size but unarmed damage
  did not correlate with unarmed% in this test: [Unarmed dmg
  test](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j8_7k0hzbuRyiuyHyCxlDp4PVGvPssLdk_adHfoyjzU/edit?usp=sharing)
- We tested and proved that metals are 50% less effective on trolls than
  on any other race. So this means metals are worth for xping, because
  you have a chance to absorb any damage under 6.5 and on any damage
  over 6.5 you can deduct 6.5. However, metals are not worth in pk
  because you run out of moves before hp and the hp difference is small.
- Ancient troll skin absorption formula by Gray, not sure if correct:
  Troll skin absorption is 50% up to (their real warrior level)/3. Also
  not sure if troll skin works together with other armor like metal.
- Healing herblore is huge for trolls and mixing success depends on WIS
- The best stats to train neglect are: PER, INT. Training down DEX is
  bad because max moves, DB depends on it and training down WIL is bad
  because sanc cap and spellsave depends on it.
- There seems to be some inherent bonus for Troll track, because all
  other races follow this table for track%, but trolls seem to get
  around +5% extra(by Zorts)
- According to our test each 1 WIL improves sanc cap by around 0.8 HP:
  [Sanc cap
  test](https://mume.org/wiki/index.php?title=General_guide_with_rare_useful_information#Skills)
- Bash speed(the time from typing bash to bash landing) is dice roll
  following normal distribution between 2.25sec and 5.75sec with median
  of 4sec. Tested by Troth, with sample size 2000, follows perfect
  normal distribution [Troth bash test
  results](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oiF7RYdvL8pDDJTVE8BtVARL4pZWgbyn/view?usp=share_link)
  - We can see from test that Troth tested with different DEX, weight,
    race, bash %, OB - nothing influenced the normal distribution
    between 2.25sec and 5.75sec with median 4sec
  - More correct way of phrasing the result: If something really affects
    the bash speed- such as DEX, bash%, weight etc - it matters so
    little that it does not show up in a test with sample size 2000.
- The Chance of Bash happening does depend on weight [The more weight
  you carry, the less successful you will
  be.](https://mume.org/help/bash)
- Unarmed damage test:
  - We tested unarmed OB and damage at 89% 93% 97% 101% and 104% [Dearth
    & Kostja Unarmed Dmg
    Test](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j8_7k0hzbuRyiuyHyCxlDp4PVGvPssLdk_adHfoyjzU/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Results were quite disappointing, no noticeable pattern, very
    random. Maybe too small sample size. Otherwise you could conclude
    that going super high unarmed % is probably not worth it.
- Max bash test
  - Bash with these stats is 108%: Str:25 Int:5 Wis:5 Dex:15 Con:16
    Wil:15 Per:6
  - Bash with these stats is 109%: (Dwarf): Str:19 Int: 9 Wis: 7 Dex:16
    Con:18 Wil:16 Per: 8
  - Please update with your STR, DEX, WIL to figure out max Bash %.
- Troll track test(Troll Track % does not follow this table for all
  other races: [Kalka Track
  Table.](https://mumewiki.kalka.org/mumetrack))
  - Int 5, Per 8 = Track 76% (Confirmed by Zorts)
  - Int 12, Per 12 = Track 26/27 91%
    - Zorts: "If you have higher stats then track % is more accurate,
      did test troll with 5 inti 13 per and that % is correct by that
      kalka. But not from stat generator."
  - Please update with max Track here to know how much troll track
    differs to other race's track.
- Dearth's character planner Google Sheet shows the amount of pracs
  available for each race at each level: [Dearth Character
  Planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XZeg21q3ffdM-hOw-Co1PSd8IrhHrh7DIwzI23TDyLw/edit#gid=1376926674)

    Endurance=**685HP**
  - lvl 45 base CON 20, base WIL 15, Age 36(1st), Endurance 58/58, 114%
    Endurance=**695HP**

### Troll Stats Examples

- All these stat recommendations below were written before Second Wind.
  Second Wind is so good that it is worth going for max endurance(CON 20
  WIL 15). STR 20 DEX 15 WIL 15 is max unarmed 104%. But this is not as
  important as max endurance.
  - I would now recommend Str:23 Int: 5 Wis: 5 Dex:14 Con:20 Wil:15 Per:
    8.
    - Train WIL -2 and STR +2, because 1 STR is ~5% more dmg.
    - DEX 14 is questionable, good for unarmed% and DB and bash but if
      you value track highly can decrease for more PER.

**OLD**

- **High HP Troll (by Kut & Enforcer)**
  - Str:25 Int:5 Wis:5 Dex:13 Con:20 Wil:14 Per: 8
  - Train WIL -1, PER -1, DEX -1, CON +2
    - Will reach ~790HP at lvl 70 in good age and after training. Each
      current CON is worth around 29hp at lvl 70, max endurance, current
      CON 23.
    - 800HP possible with levels and healing.
  - Unarmed 100%
  - Track 76%
- **Max Unarmed Troll (by Put)**
  - Str:25 Int:5 Wis:5 Dex:15 Con:16 Wil:15 Per: 6
  - Train WIL -2, DEX -1, CON +4
    - Will reach CON 20 and ~700HP at lvl 64 in good age and after
      training. Statgen shows 128 point difference for training, but
      MUME trains with decimal places. So Put might have 19.51 CON(would
      show as 20), 13.49 WIL(would show as 13), 14.49 DEX(would show as
      14)
  - Unarmed 104%
  - Max 60DB with DB quest, Black Buckler, Balrog tunic, Black Metal
    Wristband
  - Zorts: "best def troll is max unarmed troll due to max dex and db is
    king in pve"
- **High HP Tracker Troll (by Snakr)**
  - Str:25 Int: 8 Wis: 5 Dex:13 Con:20 Wil:11 Per:12
  - Train PER -2, INT -2, CON +2. Distance is 123 so might not
    work(because training in decimals). If doesn't work then neglect
    WIL.
  - Minimum 85% track
  - Almost max HP with CON 23: lvl 70 ~770HP
  - Unarmed 96%
- **Tracker Troll (by Put/Kut/Zorts)**
  - Str:25 Int: 8 Wis: 5 Dex:12 Con:19 Wil:13 Per:12
  - Unarmed 95%
  - Track minimum 85%
  - Train neglect PER,WIL,DEX, improve CON. +2 CON doable, maybe even +3
    CON with decimal places.

- **Extreme Tracker Troll - proof of concept, haven't tried (by
  Dearth)**
  - Str:23 Int: 9 Wis: 5 Dex:13 Con:20 Wil:11 Per:14
  - Train PER -3 STR +2
  - lvl 65 ~700HP

# Unarmed vs Smiting

- Best weapon class for trolls is definitely unarmed, especially after
  the changes where a lvl 25 character is the same as lvl 50. This is
  because in the past unarmed suffered from low OB, but unarmed OB
  increases with levels so now the OB is high enough because once you
  hit lvl 25 you have the same unarmed OB as lvl 50 troll 15 years ago.
  This is why trolls won the most out of the level change. A troll power
  difference between lvl 25 and lvl 50 troll 15 years ago was A LOT
  bigger than power difference from any other character going from lvl
  25 to lvl 50.
  - Unarmed DPS is a lot bigger than warsword/war mattock. Only a smiter
    troll with war mattock that is fighting a target wearing metals can
    match the DPS of an unarmed troll.
  - Weapons have ~10-12 more OB compared to unarmed.(*??? Can someone
    confirm this: lvl 25 unarmed 100% vs smiting 100% with warsword in
    Warrens*) This difference is overcome by parrysplit, OB gain by
    levels and equipment. That is why most trolls choose to be unarmed.
    - Smiting has more OB - so its better to hitflee pukes. (Although
      high level troll have high OB anyways). In level range of lvl
      40-50 there is virtually no reason to choose weapons over unarmed
      because unarmed OB is then high enough to be effective in PK.
    - Even though a weapon such as Warsword has +20OB, you can't say
      with Warsword you have +20 OB compared to Unarmed, because Unarmed
      skill gives +30 OB at 100% while weapon skills give +20 OB at
      100%. Max unarmed skill is 104%. Most trolls don't get 100% in
      Unarmed while most get a bit more in weapon skills so with a +20
      OB weapon a troll usually ends up around +12 OB when wielding a
      weapon compared to when Unarmed.
- With unarmed we can wield a rough staff with barehanded without
  getting a damage decrease. We can embed defense ingredients into staff
  at DT so it gives +25PB and weights 26lbs. Command to wear staff as
  shield: 'hold staff as shield'. Rough staff loads on apprentices, HSB
  on giants, chunk in Emyn(where exactly??), iron bar from Malardil.
  - Wearing a regular shield with unarmed reduces unarmed damage,
    holding a staff isn't counted as shield.
- You need not to be weapon troll for effective buffing. Few pracs in
  slash using dark broadsword(loads on wraiths) work even on unarmed
  troll. You even don't have to carry a shield which is heavy and lowers
  your moves and DB- you can use your +25PB staff as shield that you are
  already using with unarmed.
  - You can aim for 115-125PB in Warrens with this setup(45-75% parry,
    45-75% slashing)
  - You can argue that the +10PB you get from buffing with broadsword is
    not worth the damage lost from unarmed in wimpy. It becomes more
    worth, the less significant your damage is: only if buffing for a
    big group, it's worth.
- 40% of OB bonuses (ruby ring, bwf, weapon skill(*??? Can someone
  confirm this*), bless, enchant bonus, but not weapon OB bonus) are
  shifted to PB when in wimpy mood.

# General tips

- We(Luke&Carl&Dearth) tested and proved that metals are 50% less
  effective on trolls than on any other races. We hit each other ~100
  times in BBT and wrote down HP loss. Average hit on metals was
  44-45dmg and on troll skin 50-52dmg. Conclusion is that for trolls
  fine metals deduct max 6.5 damage from any hit. For other races fine
  metals deduct max 13 damage from any hit. So this means metals are
  worth for xping, because you have a chance to absorb any damage under
  6.5 and on any damage over 6.5 you can deduct 6.5. However, metals are
  not worth in pk because you run out of moves before hp and the hp
  difference is small.
- We(Luke&Carl&Dearth) tested the effect of current STR on troll unarmed
  damage. Again we hit each other ~100 times in BBT and wrote down HP
  loss. +2 current STR difference from 22 to 24 is 5-7dmg per hit.
  Without +2 STR hits were around 44-45, with STR ring 49-52. That means
  around 10% damage increase from STR ring. This means 1 current STR is
  around 5% damage increase. We should test if this applies on higher
  STR as well 26 current STR vs 28 current or there is a cap.
- Trolls can't anymore solo Eblees without going hurt with a hewing
  spear. Also trolls can't anymore solo Sage by doing bodyguards with
  hewing-spear.
- Best way to get vials from EP is to get barrel from BBT and fill it
  with blood of the floor of BBT
- Trolls can learn healing herblore from Frychria, but only try mix it
  with very good kit
- Trolls can provide Necromancer with baneberries and Necromancer will
  offer his alliance for the session.
- Troll players do get OB bonus for Sauron's darkness. One way to
  achieve it is by sacrificing necklaces to our Lord Sauron. Necklace
  has to be cursed before corrupting by orcs, then any caster lvl21+ can
  corrupt.
- Troll players cannot ride Fell Beasts.
- There is no way for trolls to mend shining.
- Troll player won't get any advantage from the effect of orcish battle
  horn.
- It is more difficult for trolls to get Blood of Sauron effect since
  the mob giving the item for it is aggressive vs trolls. Trolls can ask
  orcs to help them getting it. This effect will give +2 str for
  15minutes.
- Trolls need 2 ropes to climb 100% - 1 for holding and 1 for tieing
  (tie rope dir). Trolls can have 3 pracs of climb with Rahku quest.
  Rahku quest requires you to bring him top 10 warlord corpse.
- Equipment BN can often buy for trolls from Tharbad:
  - Iron ring
  - Ruby ring
  - Warsword
  - Claymore
  - Mighty Dwarven Axe
  - Engraved broadsword
  - Steel-Tipped spear
- When a Troll eats a corpse he is full for 2 MUME days.
  - Regular foods get you hungry in same amount of time as other races.
  - When a Troll is about die you can eat equipment you don't want
    opponents to have.
- Picks with 5 upgrades is needed for safely picking LBF front door.
- New useful command "score report" is built in reporting, so you don't
  display mana in your client specific alias and you don't need to
  change it when switching between sides
- There is now no difference between "kill" and "hit" when you want to
  switch targets when multiple targets are hitting you.
- Trolls can give give items to Saruman and Yerik(OIE Book and Palantir)
  but obviously hard to find Saruman for a troll. Better to give items
  to BN/orc and ask them to find Saruman.
  - These items have decent chance to get picks with Saruman upgrade +
    random upgrade: BSB, OIE book, Silvery Crown, purple scroll,
    bejewelled shield, defiled dwarven shield, BRD, dunadan blade,
    engraved hammer, ornate, warsword, PBS, banded ring
  - These items have decent chance to get scroll from Saruman: Banded,
    Iron, Jewelled ring, ruby ring, Istar wand, PBS, Staff, AoD,
    Engraved hammer, Glamdring, Ornate, Sting, Warsword, beje, shining
    chain shirt/sleeves, bsb, gleaming, OIE book, twisted crown,
    tarnished copper wristband.
  - These items have decent chance to get watch room kit from Saruman:
    Foci items, Jewelled ring, OiE Book, PBS, Jewelled ring, Palantir,
    Twisted crown, BSB. Watch room kit is detectable by detect magic and
    quite heavy.
- If anyone has hit-delay (also mobs) their defense is reduced(By
  Elestir):
  - Bulky troll tries to hit u...
  - <delay>
  - You slash troll extremely hard.
- Second Wind is capped somehow for trolls. Not sure exactly how, maybe
  the total amount of HP regenerated is capped for trolls:
  <https://discord.com/channels/497457567392333824/1053892480061419560/1260527352392319017>

# Climbing and Rahku quest

- Some climb exits do not require climb at all - just take few tries and
  consume HP. (stairs in Wight captain)
- Trolls need 2 ropes to climb 100% - 1 for holding and 1 for tieing
  (tie rope dir).
  - 17.01.21 change: Ropes decay now like dropped eq. So trolls can't
    enter Malardil from backway so easily for example.
- Is helpful when going to Ghostly captain, Unqalome, Tharbad sewers or
  crossing river Isen.
- Trolls can learn 3 pracs of climb with Rahku quest:

Go to Rahku and ask “climb”. If he says something about being able to
climb like a spider, it means the quest is active. It can not be active
for many RL days. If he's not active then this happens:

o= W\>ask rahku climb

Rahku the Mountain Troll says 'Rahku can climb like a spider!'

Rahku the Mountain Troll says 'One day, Rahku may consider teaching
you.'

o= W\>give corpse rahku

Rahku the Mountain Troll says 'Rahku not hungry now.'

Rahku the Mountain Troll gives you the corpse of \*a Half-Elf\*.

If it is active, **bring the corpse of a white warlord to Rahku. The
person had to be on white warlord list before killing him, but not
after.**

If it is active then this happens:

!= W\>ask rahku climb

Rahku the Mountain Troll says 'Rahku can climb like a spider!'

Rahku the Mountain Troll says 'Bring me a delicious, fresh puke corpse…
Good, red meat!'

Rahku the Mountain Troll says 'Make sure it is an experienced fighter,
Rahku likes those.'

Here you have to wait until he finishes talking, because if you don't
you can't prac. Gotta wait till he says it's a deal or no, then agree.

Rahku the Mountain Troll says 'Rahku may consider teaching you then.'

Rahku the Mountain Troll says 'Is it a deal?'

o= W Move:Tired\>agree rahku You agree with Rahku the Mountain Troll.

o= W Move:Tired\> Rahku the Mountain Troll says 'Good. Now go get Rahku
a lunch!' o= W\>give corpse rahku Ok. You achieved something new! Rahku
the Mountain Troll accepted to teach you how to climb like a spider!
Rahku the Mountain Troll tears a large, bloody piece from the corpse and
devours it! Rahku the Mountain Troll devours the whole corpse!

Reward: Ability to practice 3 pracs of climb. **He forgets fast that you
can practice climb from him. So best to have 3 pracs ready.**

# Sundeath

- Troll receives random hp loss when they are in the sun. Might be from
  1hp to all hp.
- When you sundie you will transform to level 1 with unmodified trophy.
  - Type 'reborn' to clean your trophy.
- Set linkdrop to avoid sundeath even if you have a stable connection.

### Avoiding Sundeath

- Have at least all the months substituted (meaning knowing when dusk
  and dawn is) and use a timer script that tells you minutes until
  sunset or sunrise. Or use mmapper2 that tells you ticks until day.
- Good idea for a client action to automatically change wimpy to 0 and
  set linkdrop to 60-120sec when you log in or reconnect.
- Have draughts or vellum scrolls for emergencies. To get draughts when
  you group with orcs, especially shamans, be polite and give them
  something before asking to mix. Also gather ingredients on your own.
- Travel light to save moves. "Tad Uncomfortable" weight should be the
  goal.
- Never take a risk of fleeing when one exit is sun. Just go berserk,
  bash and maybe they flee first. Mobdeath and especially PK death is
  not worth sunning over.
  - When fighting next to the sun exit, also make sure you have set "cha
    wimpy 0" to avoid accidentally fleeing into the sun.
- Don't Sunwalk - bad example
  [here](Brolg-Ohurk_sunwalk_by_Hawaii "wikilink").
- Be aware that you can be slept by sleep spell.
  - Wearing collar prevents that
  - This is heavily frowned upon in MUME community.
  - Avoid being cast at in open by elves who are usually pure mages who
    use sleep.
  - The sleep will be usually stored, with the person getting low to
    lure you to chase -\> casting armour -\> casting store sleep.
  - You can try to somewhat prevent that by having high willpower and
    wearing spell saving equipment, but even with base WIL 15 and max
    Spellsave equipment and high levels you are not safe: you can still
    be slept, even with a black candle.

### Common locations where people sundie

- Old Fornost sun room in castle.

<!-- -->

- Mormaeg sun room inside.

<!-- -->

- Warrens trees place - by going 2e or s e or s s e from roots. Secret
  sunned his lvl 73 troll there.

<!-- -->

- Going Old Forest and getting lost there (very common). Try to mobdie
  to trees asap if that happens.

<!-- -->

- Trying to go to OOC for night and discover that Gumak is dead. Ask a
  BN to scout it first or be sure you have good enough picks. Especially
  if leading other trolls.

<!-- -->

- When follower spams dirs at the same time when the leader does. Always
  fol self during day before typing any direction.

<!-- -->

- By typing "le" instead of "l e" which means "leave" instead of "look
  east"

<!-- -->

- Accidentally hitting flee hotkey or forgetting to set wimpy 0 during
  day

## Fine metal set

Maintaining the condition of metals requires a cross-pein hammer (swim
to it at OIE). Muranog metals usually fit to large trolls(Usually from
8ft9 by Zorts/Put).

Dol Guldur citizenship allows mending of metals. The armorer does not
'resize' metals meaning anyone with citizenship can mend for anyone
else.

## Shields

Most important thing for a shield is PB/weight/spell save ratio. Watch
out for bad condition shields - they have lower PB. Shields that are not
flawless can be worn so that they fit the user and then mended at Dol

# Areas and Strategies

- When you get blinded in a fight, only way to cure blindness is to ask
  a Shaman or recite a purple scroll.(Can you recite when blind???) BNs
  don't have cure blind.
- Always have some draughts/vellums for emergency since troll moves are
  very low. Wearing equipment that weights "tad uncomfortable" helps a
  lot.
  - Vellum creates lvl 25 Breath of Briskness so it cures everyone's
    moves in room+group.
  - To get draughts when you group with orcs, especially shamans, be
    polite and give them something before asking to mix. Also gather
    ingredients on your own.

### Warrens

- 3 guildmasters: Crusher, Clunker, Smelly
  - Crusher can be found in the Troll Crusher Cave inside the Warrens.
  - Clunker can be found eastern Warrens in and around 'A Crude, Earthy
    Tunnel'.
  - Smelly (A tall troll, its skin crawling with lice) can be found in
    the dark forest outside the Warrens.
    - All trolls in forest assist Smelly

<!-- -->

- All darkies have significant bonuses in Warrens: OB bonus, spellsave
  bonus, spell speed bonus, attack spell bonus.
  - A bashtrap with BNs and Shamans casting is most likely to succeed in
    Warrens.
- There are 3 portable rooms in Warrens, 'The Cave', 2 ologs near
  rootdoor, inside rootdoor(???)

<!-- -->

- Noflee rooms:
  - You cannot flee into or out from hatch
  - You cannot flee d from Cave
  - You cannot flee into or out from slab
  - You cannot flee into or out from room with wargs

### Sewers

- Having a boat in inventory in Sewers water rooms together with plenty
  of draughts is a way to survive being suntrapped if opponents don't
  have good swim/bob/clue, because there is a current in the water that
  drains moves fast without a boat. You can rest with boat.
- Tharbad key is extremely useful to escape via city when sewers exits
  are blocked.
  - Either ask a BN to buy it or lure mobs to pickable exit like
    staircase until a guard with key arrives, because mobs always array
    in packs of 4.
    - Btw you can do Chief also this way.
    - If too many mobs arrive at once then reset and repeat.
- If no key, pick s gate and w gate before going Sewers so you have a
  safe way out.
- No 250ms delay in Sewers

### Brolg

- Brolg room and tower are portable.
- Bushes are not blockable.
- Brolg cellar is diggable.
- Advice: fight with mobs, choose when to fight in Brolg room because
  you can't flee during day, only escape.

### OOC (Old Orkish Caves)

- Good for daytime XP on the way to Moria. Consider that if pukes see
  you in OOC they might block egate to suntrap you.
- Be prepared that Gumak might be killed and you cannot get into OOC - w
  of Gumak is not dark and is not diggable with Shovel.
  - A very common trap for pukes when they see you go OOC:
    - Enter wgate
    - Go eastgate, block the exit inside(5w from egate), wait there
      until you come, spam to egate and try block it fast. Sometimes
      people even close egate after entering.

### WNOC

- A great place to spend a night since opponents take a considerable
  risk entering it.
  - Common trap is for a BN portal u slab and block slab and crack when
    opponents enter, waterhole is not blockable nor breakable(afaik???),
    w Monitor is not blockable.
  - If a BN is in trouble they can block themselves into grey
    spider/with lithes.
  - The troll mobs are safest for trolls
- You will be likely dead suntrapped here alone vs 3 organized
  powerpukes

### Slag

- Try flee casters into guardian, they might fail flees. When they
  charge, they will try to blind you.

### Mirkwood

- Gnarled trees can bash
- You cannot escape from Eblees until a certain message

### Anduin Vale

- It is no longer possible to pick Beorn behind a door, it is possible
  to block him somewhere tho. Beorn house door is noblock.

<!-- -->

- Beorn requires a large and good group of trolls, one needs to be BN
  sanced for safety
  - Butcher for Huge black bear fur(+7OB 26lbs)
  - Drops key for his chest, in chest is Deep Black Orb (Eff v light
    15lbs)
    - "hold orb" + "use orb" to create darkness (Other effects ???)
      - You hold a deep black orb.
      - Using all your strength, you throw a deep black orb to the
        ground.
      - As the orb breaks into pieces, a black mist spreads all around.
    - Erestor for pukes gives skillful-oil herblore for orb

### LBF/Scaly monster area

- If you try to kill scaly without kit, scaly will transform the room
  into deathtrap when it gets Wounded.
  - It is possible to kill him without a kit(read Gray's guide), but not
    worth the risk of DT-ing, especially since the kit is not that hard
    to get.
- Good tactic as troll is to try fight opponents around scaly and try to
  flee enemies into scaly.
  - Scaly doesn't hit very hard, but it can bash, and has a special
    attack that inflicts 100-200 damage in one hit.
  - Underground Cavern 3w from stone guardians is safe room, scaly
    doesn't come there
- The guardians have a high chance of blocking going west, so you can
  hitflee opponents at guardian room and 1e.
  - You can get past guardian mobs by using stun-powder. Even solo
    player can bash dis both and leave.
  - You can rescue guardians.
  - When both guardians are in bash delay you can leave w.
- The room east of 2 guardians has exit east that needs a BN to have
  'dispel magic' to open.
  - So if opponents enter scaly on you, you can lure them east guardian
    and your group enter via EP.
  - All exits in EP are blockable except 1w Priest(Can someone confirm
    please???)
  - The tower of EP is portable.
- Great example by Kylhuk:
  - <http://elvenrunes.com/cgi-bin/logs/mumps?rou=show&log=61743,22558&mark=scaly>

### Kraken

- Good tactic for trolls is to flee opponents into tentacles and Kraken.
  - The higher strength you have the easier it is to break free from
    tentacles.
  - Tentacles will tie your hands meaning they can prevent casting.
  - Casting fire spells in water is not efficient.
- Having boat in inventory prevents you from failing swims. (the
  lightest boat in MUME is "narrow grey boat" which loads around Lorien
  and darkies can get it only from killing opponents)
  - (Where does a boat load near Fornost???)
- Great examples by Rotmos:
  - <http://elvenrunes.com/cgi-bin/logs/mumps?rou=show&log=59656,59157&mark=kraken>

### Wight Captain

- 4 rooms in the tower where you can stand and not ruin the stairs:
  - door room
  - 2u from the door
  - max up
  - max d
- All other rooms will eventually collapse. They collapse faster if
  multiple people stand there.
  - When rooms collapse you fall down. Only way to get out is extremely
    high climb or multiple tries. For trolls without climb pracced
    usually takes 5 tries.
  - Good idea to ask followers to turn follow off when fighting here, so
    rooms that collapse can survive longer.
- Trolls can try collapse stairs on purpose, and try flee opponents d
  tower.
  - Good idea to turn off climb all d if you accidentally hit flee you
    will try to climb u and take damage

### Bill Bert Tom (BBT)

- Entering BBT costs up to 120HP depending on weight of the character
  - After entering turn off climb because otherwise if you flee up you
    keep losing 120HP
- w, open boulder, s, 'climb hole' to get out.
- Trolls can check if BBT is alive with: 'tell bert help'
- Attacking BBT makes a troll up to level 40 wanted for 1 RL month
  - lvl 40+ will be 2 RL months wanted
  - Wanted wont disappear after reboot nor when you mobdie/sundie.
- If you stay in Treasure cave need STR 25 to open it from inside.
  - (*CAN YOU VOID THERE OR YOU WILL BE TELEPORTED OUT???*)
- When you trap there, here are couple ideas
  - Pukes might send a scout in to check if trolls inside. You can kill
    the scout, you will miss killing the whole group.
    - To avoid this you can wait behind door w s from entrance or w w
      from entrance in the cave. If they have more than 3 you might hear
      noise when they enter. (WILL YOU HEAR BATTLE NOISE???)
      - You could also use Saruman's watch room kit to watch the
        entrance.(detectable by 'detect magic')
      - It is technically possible for pukes to even check for that with
        scout ring from OIE, but almost noone ever bothers doing that.
  - Someone might cheat by asking a friend to type "where" with his
    troll near BBT
    - To avoid this somewhat: "cha incog where on"
    - Unfortunately you are not allowed to completely avoid it: "cha
      incog who on" (this command is currently disabled)

### Moria

- No 250ms movement delay.
- If you have Muranog treasury key you have a safespot
  - Key decays after some time when you're outside Moria
- If you have Bulag treasury key you also have a safespot.
  - The Bulag grey spider and Bulag will not repop with you in
    treasury.(Can someone confirm???)
  - Bulag treasure room has latch from inside
- Example by Secret:

### Liche

- Good area to spend night and use the lift, liche door key and climbing
  exits in your advantage
- Helps if you are carrying 2-4 ropes
- Here are some damages for falling in the lift shaft (Depends on your
  weight and encumbrance):
  - Top to bottom: 330hp
  - Top to middle: 85hp
  - Middle to w liche: 85hp
  - Top rope to bottom rope : 120hp
  - Middle rope to bottom rope: 65hp

### Unqalome

- All keys to all doors won't necessarily pop every time.
- The damage of your fall there will depend on how high is the floor you
  are falling from, also the weight of you and your EQ. Falling from top
  floor will most likely kill anyone.
- Armour spell won't protect BNs against that damage.

# Shovel

- Loads Khuzur every half year.
- To use: 'dig down', then dig either n s e w.
- Costs 15 move points to dig one room.
- Can't dig further down and can't dig up. Also limit to digging max
  distance N/E/S/W.
- As all artifacts, it will decay in about 1 real-life week.
- Most indoor rooms aren't diggable.
- You can only dig 50 rooms total.
- Anyone voided in the tunnels when they collapse is treated as if they
  entered a dt.
- Tunnel will decay if nobody is in the tunnel at the next tick.

# Speed Levelling guide

- Best time to play troll is when the season is the closest to winter
  since nights are longer.
- Also baneberries that are needed for getting gleaming belt pop at
  winter and for Necromancer entry.

## Before Levelling

Popular to run TPs before the XP starts. As a level 4(5-10min), you can
Prac 15xwilderness and run as deep into Shire as you can. Try swimdie
but mobdie is fine as well. Get smooth and skip FGC because you need it
later.

## Level 1-6

- Max Wilderness, Max Unarmed, get some Endurance and Parry

Mobs to kill: young trolls, spiders, bats, deers, warg, wolves

## Level 6-14

This would be very good time to group with other trolls approx. your
level. Get 3 troll group moving and you wont be needing to stop for heal
(if you dont take too strong mobs)

Practice: bash (as it will get useful around level 8), rescue - if you
are grouping.

Places: Warrens, forest, around DT, Wnoc.

Mobs: When you get your bash working poorly (~ 50%) you can take up
troll bitch and maybe earth trolls, who will bash you if you dont. The
same tactic works outside too, especially against solo mobs who are
bashable, for example bear north of black boots, assassin near ep, bear
inside "bushes" near SSC, solo black funguses SE from warrens.

Note: Troll infants will assist troll bitch. Earth trolls wont assist
each other.

Time estimation: Can be done in 3-6 hours (depending on group size)

## Level 14-21

Mobs: Bash will start working on higher mobs : old trolls, brutish
trolls, grey mountain trolls, olog trolls, crusher, clunker, smelly
troll. If large enough group - also guildmasters.

NOTE: Clunker will not assist his old trolls, but all the other mobs
mentioned here do. Be extra careful in dreary forest when taking smelly
down - you could have the whole forest assistting you!

Prac: About level 18-19 you have maxxed your unarmed combat (weapons
much earlier) so you can start working on parry or track (if you are
tracker). Pure unarmed trolls go for maxing endurance.

Time estimation: Can be done in 6-12 hours (depending on group yet
again) - It is possible to gain 21 levels after 12 hours of exping.

## Level 21-26

Prac: continue pracing track/endurance/parry or take up another weapon
skill. Mobs: Now you can kill almost anything that is 1vs1 and not
supermob. Now it time to move out of warrens to exp in goblin caves,
wnoc(noc), ooc, mirkwood, moria or raid cities like Bree and Fornost.
Nice to start collecting equipment from various places (shields,
scrolls, weapons)

This is also the minimum level to start PKing heavily:)

Time Estimation: Can be done in 6-12 hours (depending on group)

## Level 26+

A troll who doesnt mobdie/pkdie often can level up to 50 quite rapidly
(in the triangle of necro eblees and Urgorl). After that it gets slower
and slower - need to take up raiding or pk-ing.

By leveling forward you gain both OB and HP. (level 50 troll can have
200 OB and 700hp in Warrens with no special equipment). Weapon trolls
will have even more OB.
