Using this command you select how you edit text in MUME.

By selecting "line", you get to use the default MUME in-game line
editor.

By selecting "mume", the MUME remote editing protocol is used (if your
client supports it). In powwow, this behaviour is controlled by the
POWWOWEDITOR environment variable.
