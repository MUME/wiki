The **Rohirrim** are the Horse Lords of [Rohan](Rohan "wikilink"). Their
name for themselves is the Eorlingas. They are tall, blond-haired, and
often blue-eyed. They are by nature stern, fierce, and grave, yet
generous. Their native language is [Rohirric](Rohirric "wikilink").
Considered *Middle Men* by the [Elves](Elf "wikilink") and
[Dúnedain](Dúnedain "wikilink"), they founded few cities (their capital
Edoras is the primary one) but rather have a nomadic culture built
around horses. Their bravery and horsemanship are great assets in the
war against evil.
