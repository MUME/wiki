The origin of **hobbits** is uncertain, though it's known that they
existed long before coming to their current main home in the
[Shire](Shire "wikilink"). Hobbits are a small folk, being about half
the size of a [man](man "wikilink"). They fear other
[races](race "wikilink"), treating them with superstition. However, they
are a very-strong willed people, who when forced to fight can do so with
vigour. It's recorded how the Shire Hobbits managed to defend their home
from an [Orcish](Orc "wikilink") attack many years ago. There are only
two known places where Hobbits are known to live, those being the
original settlement of [Bree](Bree "wikilink"), and the
[Shire](Shire "wikilink"). They are known as Halflings by the
[Humans](Man "wikilink"), and the Periannath by the
[Elves](elf "wikilink").

## Hobbits in [Mume](MUME "wikilink")

Hobbits within Mume are in most respect identical to Tolkien's
descriptions. They are, for obvious reasons, found in places other than
the [Shire](Shire "wikilink") and [Bree](Bree "wikilink"). With their
quick reflexes and light bodies, they make ideal
[thieves](thief "wikilink"). This was grasped by Thorin II and his party
when they took to finding a Hobbit to reclaim their lost home. They have
the following modifications to other races:

- gain advantages over other races in sneaking when barefoot
- their bare feet have similar absorb and movement bonuses as high
  quality leather boots
- are disadvantaged when fighting against trolls
- suffer penalties when riding large mounts and should thus ride ponies

Hobbits can start the game in the [Shire](Shire "wikilink"), the [Tower
Hills](Tower_Hills "wikilink"), [Fornost](Fornost "wikilink"), or
[Bree](Bree "wikilink").

### Subraces

#### Stoor

In the time of MUME Stoor Hobbits main settlement areas are the Shire's
Eastfarthing and Buckland close to the Brandywine River. They are
particularly stout and adapt at living close to bodies of water. In MUME
this subrace has the following modifications:

- Base [Swim](Swim "wikilink") Skill: 25%
- Base [Endurance](Endurance "wikilink") Skill: 10%
- Feet have a higher absorption value (unknown how much, like fine
  chain?, fine metal?)

#### Fallohid

- When led by a Fallohid Hobbit, others get the full [travel
  points](travel_points "wikilink") amount.
- When a Fallohid Hobbit follows someone, they still get the full amount
  of Travel points.
- For mixing [herblores](herblores "wikilink") they get a bonus for both
  success and possiblty to create 2 portions (allegedly equals +2
  [kit](herbal_kit "wikilink") upgrades)
- [Smoking](Smoking "wikilink") pipe-weed will never fail and chance for
  higher mana gain is increased.
