title: "Ragged, blackened cloak"
---

\> **look cloak**
Minuscule green and brown hues are barely visible on this blackened
cloak.
Although it is ragged in some places, it still provides some cover from
the
elements of nature. At the top of the cloak, two small leathery strings
are
attached, from which a faint rotting smell emanates.
\>**consider cloak**
It is a ragged, blackened cloak.
It weighs a couple of pounds.
