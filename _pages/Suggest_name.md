Syntax: **suggest** (a) **name** (for) (a) <gender> <race>

This command accesses [MUME](MUME "wikilink")'s name generator and
suggests a name for the specified sex/[race](race "wikilink").

Example:

`> suggest name male hobbit`

Accepted races/subraces:

[`Beorning`](Beorning "wikilink")`            Numenorean          Dunadan             `[`Dwarf`](Dwarf "wikilink")
`Eriadorian          `[`Half-elf`](Half-elf "wikilink")`            `[`Hobbit`](Hobbit "wikilink")`              Noldor`
[`Orc`](Orc "wikilink")`                 Rohir               `[`Troll`](Troll "wikilink")`               Silvan`
`Sindar              Oldelf              Oldorc`

Some notes:

- Orc/troll male/female all use the same name pool.

<!-- -->

- Beorning and Eriadorian use the same name pool.

<!-- -->

- Oldelf and oldorc were works in progress which both have decent-sized
  name pools to draw from. Their eventual fate is undecided.

<!-- -->

- Half-elves use the Sindarin name pool.

Words of warning: The total amount of names that can be generated number
in the millions. It is unavoidable that not all of them are good. Some
will no doubt be awful.

It is also likely that some names that break '[Rules
Names](Rules_Names "wikilink")' can be generated. That a name came from
the name generator does not give it a free pass from 'Rules Names'.
