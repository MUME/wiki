In order to **write** a note, you need a piece of blank paper (often
available at your local grocer) and a [quill pen](quill_pen "wikilink").
You need to '[hold](hold "wikilink")' the pen and then 'write note'. To
read the note, you need to 'hold' the note and '[read](read "wikilink")
note'.

To write a message on a bulletin [board](boards "wikilink"), use 'write
<subject>' in the [room](room "wikilink") where the board is. You may
also want to [reply](reply "wikilink") to the last message you read.

This command will take you into your chosen [editor](editor "wikilink")
(from '[change](change "wikilink") editor'). For the standard line
editor, you may exit by entering %e on a new line.
