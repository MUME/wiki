In certain towns and home areas one may purchase animals. A common
example of this is the ability to buy a horse. One can also buy more
traditional pet animals such as pigeons, cats, and dogs. At the time of
purchase you can usually name your pet. Pets can be useful in many ways,
however using them to spam communication channels is a bad idea.
