**Guide Camping and Campfires and Cooking in MUME**

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

Campfires are a very valuable asset to playing MUME. Especially for new
players.

Many parts of this guide reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at:

<https://mume.org/help/help_index>

**Bold** words can be looked up in the games help files. Like help
**camp**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Campfires**

To make a **campfire**, use the command **camp**. It has a delay and
will take a few seconds to build your **campfire**. Any character can do
it, even if you are naked. Campfires are built faster or with a shorter
delay if you have **Wilderness** skill. Campfires eventually burn out,
but if you type **camp** again, you can refresh it with new wood. You
cannot camp in cities, buildings, on open water (rivers, lakes, ocean,
etc), or in some caves. But otherwise you can camp in almost any room
outside in the game, even in swamps and marshes.

Some areas of the game dislike campfires being built there. Beware in
the Forest of Fangorn. The Ents and Huorns there do not like fires being
set in their woods. Type **complain** to see if you have upset the
Forest of Fangorn.

## **What can campfires help you with?**

Once a campfire is made it has the following benefits. It lights up the
room and acts as a **light** source. You can even build a campfire in
the dark. It also warms the room up some, raising the temperature. But
not enough to melt ice. If it is cold or chilly in a room, lighting a
campfire might raise the temperature up to mild or warm, which means it
is safe to **sleep** there without catching the flu. If the room is too
cold, you have a chance of catching the **disease** flu while sleeping.

To check the temperature in the room use the command **weather local**.
If it is mild or warmer, you probably won't get the flu. If it is chilly
colder, you've got an increased change of catching the flu. Check out
**help diseases**.

`camp, weather local, sleep`

Some mobs are scared of fire and will flee at the sight one, instead of
attacking you. So it can be a type of defense if you need to rest
outside. It will not stop all mobs from attacking you, but many normal
forest animals don't like open fire.

You can also get crude torches from a campfire. Use the command **get
torch fire**. They are not very good **light** sources and do not last
very long, but they are free to make. Burned out torches are useless
weight, just drop them.

`camp, get torch fire, hold torch, rem torch, drop torch`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Campfire Cooking**

One major benefit of campfires is being able to **cook** at one. You
need a **pan** to **cook**. You can hold the **pan** or **wear** it on
your belt, but they can also **cook** just from being in your
**inventory**. You can cook raw meat, which makes it smoked meat. Smoked
meat lasts longer before it decays and weights a little bit less. If you
have **salt** in your **inventory**, you can cook smoked and cured meat.
Smoked and cured meat lasts even longer before it decays and weighs a
little bit less. Cooked meats can also be sold at some grocer shops for
small amounts of coins. It's a slow way to make money, but works!

Some rooms in the game already have campfires going in them, or maybe a
fireplace. Those rooms tend to be warmer for sleeping, and you can cook
at most of them.

If you have a **casserole** you can also use the **boil** command to
make other dishes, stews, and soups. You need to add water or another
liquid to the **casserole** first. Look at help **boil** command for
more information.

`butcher corpse, butcher 2.corpse, camp, cook raw, boil casserole, put carrot casserole, put pepper casserole`

There are even some **herblore**s that need to be cooked once they are
made as well.

Campfires can even be used to **mend** some gear in the game. If you
have a cross pien hammer, you can **mend** some metal items at a
campfire with varying degrees of success. Some Sinda **elves** are
particularly good at this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **BN camp rent**

If you are playing as a **Black Númenórean** campfires can be used like
an **inn** in towns. You can use the command **camp rent** to log out in
many areas of the **map**. They even work for retiring a **Black
Númenórean** character.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Some drawbacks of camping**

There are a few drawbacks of camping, but forest fires is not one of
them. You won't burn down any areas of the game with a campfire. You can
use the torches taken from a campfire to **burn** some webs in the game,
however.

If some player runs across a campfire and sees it burning they can look
for **track**s there, and possibly find you if you've walked away from
the campfire. The campfire is a sign that some was was recently in that
room.

There is also a command called "**look around**" that allows any player
to scan the zone around them and look for signs of smoke rising up from
campfires. It's not very direct, but can help you find your way back in
the general direction of a campfire.

You can use the **'cover campfire**' command to help reduce the light it
provides.

So make a campfire today and start practicing some of those survival
skills! It just takes a minute to try most of them out.
