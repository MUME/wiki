The continent of Middle-earth was shaped at the most ancient days of
Arda. It lay to the east of the other great continent of Aman (Undying
Lands), and was separted from Middle-earth by the Great Sea Belegaer.

At the end of the Third Age, the continent of Aman finally departs from
Arda, leaving the mortal realm of Middle-earth which would eventually
evolve into Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.
