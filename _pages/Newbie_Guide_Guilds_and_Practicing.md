**Newbie Guide Guilds and Practicing**

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

“It is perilous to study too deeply the arts of the Enemy, for good or
for ill.”

Elrond, JRRT, The Fellowship of the Ring

This guide is all about practicing and the different guilds in the game.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at:

- [MUME Help files](https://mume.org/help/help_index)

**Bold** words can be looked up in the games help files. Like help
**practice**.

## **Improvements by Leveling and not Practicing**

As you level up in the game, the following stats will simply improve as
your levels increase, no practices or guilds are needed:

Your hit points will go up.
Mana costs for spells will go down, chance to backfire slightly will go
down.
Spell casting speed will very slightly get shorter and shorter.
Your OB% (offensive bonus) will go up, slowly.

## **Practice Makes Perfect (or at least better!)**

You start the game with practices. Every time you gain a level, you get
more practices. Practices are what you spend at guilds to get better at
a skill or spell. If you type practice outside of a guild, you will see
how many practices you have to spend. Practice will show you a list of
all the skills or spells you know. It will also estimate how well you
know them, from awful to superb.

1 - 16%: Awful 17 - 29%: Bad 30 - 39%: Poor 40 - 62%: Average 63 - 69%:
Fair 70 - 80%: Good 81 - 92%: Very good 93 -100%: Excellent 101%+:
Superb

Typing practice outside of a guild looks like this:

You have 5 practice sessions left. Skill Knowledge Difficulty Class
------------------------------------------------ Bandage Bad Easy None
Wilderness Bad Normal None Dodge Bad Hard Thief Search Bad Normal Thief
Parry Poor Normal Warrior Slashing weapons Average Normal Warrior

If you are in a guild and type practice, you will see all the skills or
spells it offers, that you have access to at your level. You'll also see
your progress on learning any of those skills. The guild master will
also give some practice advice, like if you are well suited to learn
more, or know more about the skill then they can offer you. Here is an
example from the warrior guild:

You have five practice sessions left. A retired warrior can teach you
the skills below. Skill Sessions Knowl. Diffic. Advice
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bash 0/15 0% Hard I can't teach you enough Cleaving weapons 0/12 0%
Normal You could learn easily Concussion weapons 0/12 0% Normal You
could learn easily Endurance 0/10 0% Very hard I can't teach you enough
Parry 2/10 38% Normal Easy to improve Rescue 0/ 5 0% Easy You could
learn easily Slashing weapons 4/12 54% Normal You reached your current
limit Stabbing weapons 0/12 0% Normal You could learn easily

## **Guilds**

Guilds are where you practice skills or spells in the game. There will
be a guild master that does the instructing. If you type practice at a
guild, you will see a list of all the skills or spells you can currently
attempt to practice. As you level up, you might see more added to your
list, now that you can get access to them.

Then to advance or increase a skill or spell type prac <skill or spell>.
For every one time you prac a skill, you use up one available practice.
You cannot practice if you have 0 or less pracs. You can get negative
pracs by losing a level.

`prac dodge, prac slash, prac cure light, prac ride`

## **Types of Guilds**

There are 5 main types of guilds for the Free Peoples of the West. And a
very few 'speciality' guilds here and there. There are also guilds that
are more for lower level, mid level, and higher level characters.


Low Level Guild: Some guilds you will find in the game over all have
lower caps you can


practice skills or spells up to. These guilds tend to focus on levels
1-5. You will

find yourself quickly out leveling alot of what they offer.

<!-- -->


Mid Level Guild: A few guilds you might find are more 'mid level' or a
mix of low level and


mid level, or maybe even mid level, and high level. They tend to help
more with levels

5-15 or so.

<!-- -->


High Level Guild: Last are guilds that are at the top of the game. These
higher level guilds


often let you max practice quite a number of skills. They tend to be the
focus of lvl 15-26,

and beyond.

<!-- -->


Ranger Guild: The ranger guild has a wide variety of skills. Many of
them deal with exploring


and getting around, trying to make traveling easier. It is called the
Ranger guild but many

different classes use skills from this guild often.

<!-- -->


Warrior Guild: This guild teaches most of the combat skills in the game.
It focuses on weapon


skills and other moves and tricks you can do in combat.

<!-- -->


Thief/Scout Guild: This guild teaches a few combat skills in the game.
But mostly it focuses


on skills that make you sneaky and stealthy.

<!-- -->


Mage Guild: This guild teaches mage spells. Over all mage spells tend to
focus on defense,


damage, teleporting, and trying to find out information.

<!-- -->


Cleric Guild: The cleric guild teaches cleric spells. Cleric spells
focus on healing,


recovery, removing negative conditions, and bolstering fellowship
members.

<!-- -->


Specialty Guild: These rare guilds only teach one skill, or very few
skills. Some notable


examples are:

- - riding guild (ranger) in a small village north of Ingrove
  - archery guild (thief) W of Lorien
  - poison guild (thief) NE of Rivendell

## **Difficulty of Increasing Skills and Spells**

When you are in or out of a guild, you will see how difficult a specific
skill or spell is to practice. This roughly means how much % you get
with each prac. Harder skills use up more pracs then easy skills. So you
might do very well with a few pracs into a very easy skill or easy
skill, but you'll get MUCH less % gains in harder skills.

very easy easy normal hard very hard

Also related to this, is how practiced you are at the skill. At low % it
is much easier to increase a skill by practicing. But as you get closer
to 100% it gets MUCH harder. Early on you might have gained like 14%
with one prac! But later on you go from 88% to 90% with one practice.
Getting skills high gets much more prac expensive!

You will also notice a few skills in the game limit how much of it you
can practice at a time. It will give you a message like "you need to be
more experienced to practice further." That means you need to gain a
level to spend any more practices at that skill.

## **Skills in Guilds**

Every skill in the game has a help file that describes how it is used.
Please check them out if you are thinking of getting a skill. It will
also tell you what commands are used with the skill. Here is a quick
description of what each skill can do for you.

## **Combat Skill Ratio**

These are the easiest skills to understand in all of MUME, in how they
affect your character. All combat skills operate on the same ratio. 5% =
1%

- 5% parry skill = 1 % PB
- 5% dodge skill = 1% DB
- 5% all melee weapon skills = 1% OB when wielding that weapon type
- 5% in missile = 1% M_OB when wielding missile weapons

So if you prac 25% dodge you get +5% DB, or 100% parry you get 20% PB.

## **Guild Issues You Could Encounter**

A few guilds in the game are closed during certain hours. They will tell
you what their hours are so you know when to come back and practice at
them.

A few guild masters in the game wander and walk around. They do not stay
in the same room all the time. Most annoyingly, are the guild masters
that sneak while they move. Some even go home for the night, and return
to the guild the next day.

Some guild masters are racist, and will only let characters of certain
races practice at them. You could find hobbit only or dwarf only guilds,
for example.

Some guilds are very secretive and hidden, making them hard to find. You
may need to search to find them or ask someone else to show you how to
enter.

A few guilds are greedy, and charge for their services. You need to pay
somehow in order to enter them.

Guilds that offer higher level or higher % can often be in areas of the
game more risky to visit.

## **Abilities For Each Skill**

Each skill and spell in the game has 2 or 3 abilities tied to it. The
higher your ability scores are, the higher of a % you get when
practicing the skill. If your abilities are lower, you'll get less %
when you practice the skill.

They are listed in order of importance. The first ability affects the
skill the most, with the second a lesser effect, and the third (if the
skill has one) even a lesser extent.

If you ask a guild master about a skill or spell, they will give you
some information about the skill or spell and what abilities affect it.
You can also find this information in some of the help files about the
skills or spells.

ask thief help dodge
ask ranger help bandage
ask mage help create light
ask cleric help bless
ask warrior help parry
ask hunter help dodge You ask an accomplished hunter 'help dodge' An
accomplished hunter thinks till it hurts. An accomplished hunter tells
you 'Dodging is crucial for survival in these hard' An accomplished
hunter tells you 'times. If you practice long and hard enough,' An
accomplished hunter tells you 'you will be able to dodge even the
largest' An accomplished hunter tells you 'trolls or the greatest
beasts. A dodged hit' An accomplished hunter tells you 'means a longer
life.' An accomplished hunter tells you 'To master this skill, great
agility and good' An accomplished hunter tells you 'eyesight are
required.'

help dodge DODGE (Thief Skill) Similar to parry, this skill will
increase your basic dodging bonus. This is heavily affected by dexterity
and the amount you are carrying. The number of foes doesn't affect your
dodging bonus (DB) Dodging is crucial for survival in these hard times.
If you practice long and hard enough, you will be able to dodge even the
largest trolls or the greatest beasts. A dodged hit means a longer life.
To master this skill, great agility and good eyesight are required.

## **Guilds and Guild Masters**

Here is a link to a pretty good list of guilds and guild masters in
MUME. Also, if you are using mmapper to play, you will sometimes see a
**G** on your map in a room. That is a room with a guild master.

<https://mume.org/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Guildmasters>

## **Abilities in MUME**

If the guild master gives you some tips about a skill or spell, here is
a list that might help you understand which ability score they are
talking about.

Muscle = Strength
Agility = Dexterity
Iron nerves = Will power
Health = Constitution
Eyesight = Perception
Brilliant mind = Intelligence
Deep insight = Wisdom
Here's some brief descriptions about how each ability is used in the
game. You can type help <ability> to find out more. Like help
Perception, or help Wisdom.

Strength: Important for picking up and wearing heavy stuff, wielding
weapons, climbing, swimming.

## **Teaching and Learning**

You can actually learn skills in the game from other players instead of
visiting a guild. To do so, you need to use the "teach" and "learn"
commands. It has some limitations of who can teach who and how high of a
% you can get the skill. But if you need some pracs in a skill far from
a guild, this is the only way to do it.

`help teach, help learn, teach, learn`

## **Pure Class vs Combo Class**

MUME's class system is one of the most interesting features in the game.
It is very dynamic and allows you to customize your own class very well.
Generally characters fall into two categories: pure class or combo
class.

I recommend if you are new to the game and just starting out, try making
a pure class first. You will be effective and learn alot while you are
doing it. I would strongly recommmed some type of warrior or maybe a
scout/thief for a first character. Casters can eventually be powerful,
but are more difficult to level up. Game knowledge will help with that.

### Pure Class

Pure class characters do not have 100% of their skills only in one
class. But



they very much do tend to focus on one class. Like almost all warrior
skills or almost

all thief skills. This does not mean that warrior cannot practice
outside of the warrior class

however. It is VERY COMMON for a 'pure warrior' to have a few pracs in
pick (a thief skill) or

maybe a few pracs in cure light (a cleric spell).

### Combo Class

These characters practice in more then one guild by design. Some common
combos



people try to make are: Ranger type, defense warrior, battle clerics,
warrior/scout, thief-mages, warmage, etc...

Combo classes can often do some more variety of feats and tasks then a
pure class, but very

often does not do them quite as well. So you might tend to fail at a
skill more often then

a pure class would. But you usually gain some more flexibility.

## **Practicing Cross Class**

When you start to practice alot of skills out of your main class, you
will begin to notice a cross class penalty. It can be confusing, so here
are some basics.

First none of the skills in the ranger guild affect ANY of the other
classes skills. Ranger skills can be practiced without penalty by any
classes in the game.

Next, some classes tend to hurt when practicing cross class MORE then
others do. Warrior vs scout pracs and mage vs cleric pracs do penalize
you, but not as much. Warrior vs mage and thief vs cleric tend to
penalize you just a bit more. This is in the game to try and reduce the
number of sleeping backstabbers or bashing fireballers, sort of.

So for example if you are a warrior with high parry, a weapon skill, and
bash, and then decide to start practicing the spell fireball, you will
notice that your warrior skill % start to drop some. Maybe it used to be
at 90% and now it is down to more like 81%. It will drop more and more
as you practice the mage spell higher and higher. Notice you can still
use the skills, you will just have less success.

If you keep your practices cross class lower %, they do not penalize you
as much. So having a skill at 20%-25% maybe 30% you will not notice very
many issues with cross class practicing. It might not even lower your
main class pracs much at all. But if you start practicing those skills
higher you will notice that your max % you can get may no longer be up
around 100%.

So, you will see many warriors with 1-2 pracs in pick. They can still
open alot of doors, and it does not hurt their main warrior class pracs
doing it. Another example is a mage that has 35% in create food. They
get the benefit of the skill, backfire rarely, and it does not hurt
their mage %.

## **Benefits of Maxing... or Not**

If you improve a skill, you generally get better at it. But that does
not mean you need to max that skill. Many skills in the game are
'useable' without being at 100%. You might not be able to be successful
in EVERY circumstance, but you will likely get by just fine.

One major benefit of NOT maxing a skill or pumping it up to 100% is that
it gives you more practices to spend elsewhere. This can mean a wider
variety of skills or spells you can afford by not trying to get every
skill as high as possible. However, if it is a skill you really depend
on in combat, you'll probably want it 85%-105%.

Out of combat spells are a good example of this. You might be just fine
having it at 50%. Sure you might backfire 3% of the time, but since it's
not in combat, it's not really a big deal. Another example is 50%
bandage is very useable, even if it is not the 'best'. Many non-thieves
have 1-2 pracs in pick.

## **Decay Skills or Spells**

There is 1 way your skills or spells can decay. As skills decay, they
turn back in to practices you can spend again. Decay often takes a long
time, even longer if you have the skill practiced up very high. One
benefit of this is that you can get rid of a skill you don't like, don't
use, or no longer need. And can try out something new.

`train slash, train cure light, train climb, train call familiar, train all`

## **Practice Reset**

You can also change ALL of your pracs with a **prac reset**. This does
not allow you to pick and choose which skills you want to change, it's
all or nothing. If you want to remake your character this could be an
option to change all of your skills. You'll be reset back to no skills
and alot of practices to spend.

To get a prac reset, you need to rent **retire** for one real life
month. After the month is up, when you type info in the account menu for
that character, it will let you know if you are eligible for a practice
reset. Just log into your retired character and type pracreset.

Help **prac reset** and **help retirement** for more information.

## **Character Class**

You can change the class of your character at any time. As you level up
and practice, your character's class choices may change. Use the change
class command to see what classes are available for you to choose from.
The classes are heavily based off of what skills or combination of
skills you have practiced.

chan class You can choose between Adventurer, Apprentice, Pilferer,
Recruit and Scout. chan class scout

So go out and see what classes you can become while you level up and
practice with your character!
