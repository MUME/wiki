\> **examine apple**
The apple is glossy, honey-coloured, and almost transparent. Looking
through
it at a light, you can see its core and seeds, and when it is shadowed
from
light, it seems to shine from the inside. Its smell is fresh, yet richer
and
sweeter than the smell of an ordinary apple.
\> **consider apple**
It is a large yellow apple.
It weighs half a pound.
