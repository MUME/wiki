1\. Players can only have _ONE_ account.

`  The penalty for having more than one account is beyond imagination.`

2\. An account can only have _ONE_ owner and user.

`  The penalties for sharing an account are painful beyond belief.`

3\. An account must not be traded or given away.

`  Traded/shared/given accounts will be deleted completely.`

N.b. If you have accidentally made more than one account, please stop
playing all of them except one. Then contact an Arata and ask for your
other accounts to be merged together.
