## Steal

(Thief Skill) \[Delayed Command\]

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, if the person is
asleep, and the level of the victim compared to thief.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it is not possible to steal from
players. You can still steal from mobiles at any level.

There is a limit to what may be stolen from players, depending on your
and your victim's levels.

NOTE: If you steal from players it is their right to get their goods
back even over your dead body. Also note that if citizens of a town see
you stealing you will become wanted for your crimes in that town. Please
note also that spam stealing (repeatedly issuing the steal command
against one victim) is ILLEGAL and will be punished.

Example:

`  > steal gold drunk`

Ability to steal also makes you capable of guessing what one has in his
pockets when you EXAMINE them.
