**Steal** is a [thief](thief "wikilink") [skill](skill "wikilink") that
allows you to steal [gold](gold "wikilink") or items from people. The
chance of not getting caught depends on how well you have
[practiced](practice "wikilink") steal, if the person is asleep, and the
level of the victim compared to thief.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it is not possible to steal from
players. You can still steal from [mobiles](mobile "wikilink") at any
level.

Also note that if citizens of a town see you stealing you will become
wanted for your crimes in that town. Please note also that spam stealing
(repeatedly issuing the steal command against one victim) is ILLEGAL and
will be punished.

Example:

`  > steal gold drunk`

Ability to steal also makes you capable of guessing what one has in his
pockets when you EXAMINE them.

This skill is considered largely useless, but might be worth putting one
practice into it so you can see other people's
[inventories](inventory "wikilink").
