title: Backfire
---

A backfire will occur when you'll highly fail to cast a spell, the
effects become nastier as the spell level increases. However, your
knowledge of the spell can reduce the chance of backfire.

Following the severity of the backfire, the effects can result in a loss
of mana points, a loss of mana points and move points or a loss of mana
points, move points and hit points.

Remember: Backfiring a low level spell will not cause great harm,
backfiring a level 15 spell is another story...
