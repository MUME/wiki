A **backfire** will occur when you fail to [cast](cast "wikilink") a
[spell](spell "wikilink"). The effects become nastier as the spell level
increases. However, your knowledge of the spell can reduce the chance of
backfire.

Following the severity of the backfire, the effects can result in a loss
of [mana](mana "wikilink") points, a loss of mana points and [movement
points](movement_points "wikilink") or a loss of mana points, move
points and [hit points](hit_points "wikilink").

Remember: Backfiring a low level spell will not cause great harm,
backfiring a level 15 spell is another story...
