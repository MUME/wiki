\> **look coif**

Many small rings have been interwoven to form a decent armour for the
head.

Long chains hang over the neck and the cheeks, improving protection but
also

hindering sight as well as the head's freedom of movement.

\> **consider coif**

It is a chain mail coif.

It weighs four pounds.
