A long and thin knife, or perhaps a short and thin shortsword, the
stiletto

is long and slim with a dangerously sharp point.

It is a stiletto.

This piercing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is awful while attacking and average while defending; its speed is
very fast, and it inflicts very little damage upon hitting.

It weighs about one pound.
