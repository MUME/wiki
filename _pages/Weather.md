Syntax: weather {local\|global\|fog}

"weather global" produces a complex weathermap of Middle-Earth. This map
gives you the weather type in the whole world using the following signs:

<div>

`                   : nice weather`
`                 ~ : clouds`
`                 ' : rain`
`                 " : heavy rain`
`                 * : snow`

</div>

The letters you can see when the weather is nice represent the cities of
Middle-Earth. See [Map](Map "wikilink") to learn about those.

Weather may have several influences in the game (increasing/reducing
move costs or vision, dehydration, favouring illnesses, and so on...).

"weather fog" behaves in a similar way, but it shows areas of light and
thick fog. Fog may hinder your sight and might even make locating
yourself quite hard.

If you want to know about the weather in your nearer vicinity, you can
use the "weather local" command.

It is rumoured powerful magic may alter the course of the local weather.
