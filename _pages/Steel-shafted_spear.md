title: Steel-shafted spear
---

\> **look spear**

This spear is five feet in length, and the shaft is composed entirely of
steel.

The head is long and broad and composed of a dark metal. The metal of
the head

was fused to the shaft with a great amount of heat and force. The spear
was

never refinished or polished, making the weapon crude looking, but very

effective.

\> **consider spear**

It is a steel-shafted spear (flawless, new).

This stabbing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is average while attacking and good while defending; its speed is
slow, and it inflicts average damage upon hitting.

It weighs four pounds.

## Opinion

When max enchanted this spear make most damage per time unit, more than
[a giant spear](a_giant_spear "wikilink") for example.
