**Say**, **whisper** and **ask** can be used to communicate with players
or [mobiles](mobile "wikilink") in the same [room](room "wikilink"). For
long-distance communication, use [tell](tell "wikilink").

Say is heard by everyone in your room, while ask and whisper are only
heard by the person who you are talking to.

Examples:

` > Whisper thief Wanna teach me some illegal stuff?`
` > Ask bilbo Have you found that ring yet?`
` > Say Hi guys, lets go orc hunting?!`
` > Comment duh gotta go AFK a sec, building on fire`

Notes:

- All commands except 'comment' (that can be abbreviated '-') are meant
  for In Character (IC) communication. Communication on player to player
  level is held with the 'comment' command.

<!-- -->

- Apostrophe (') is a shorter form of the 'say' command;

- The outputs of 'say', 'whisper', 'ask' and
  '[narrate](narrate "wikilink")' are influenced by the comprehension
  level of the [language](language "wikilink") that is being used,
  'tell' and '[emote](emote "wikilink")' are not.
