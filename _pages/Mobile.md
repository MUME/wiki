PC is sometimes used as a short form of Player Character, which simply
means a player.

A [mobile](mobile "wikilink"), or mob for short, is often referred to as
a Non-Player-Character, or **NPC**. These are all monsters in the game.

Some mobiles in the game will speak with you, providing information. In
order to address them, just ASK them something, or WHISPER; you can also
"SAY mobilename, sentence" - for instance. If the mobile is the only
other person in the room, you don't need to give its name of course.
Also, in an ongoing conversation, you don't need to include the mobile's
name each time.

` say Barliman, hello!`

If you are alone in a room with a mobile and speak, of course, the mob
will assume you're speaking to him.
