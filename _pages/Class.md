[Moria](Moria "wikilink") in *[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of
the
Ring](The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring_(film) "wikilink")*\]\]
The **class** system of [MUME](MUME "wikilink") is very flexible. You do
not have to choose a class on [character](character "wikilink")
creation - instead, you can shape it later by
[practicing](practice "wikilink") [skills](skill "wikilink") or
[spells](spell "wikilink") of a specific class. Even then, you are not
restricted to skills (or spells) of only one class, but you can practice
additional skills (or spells) from [guilds](guild "wikilink") other than
that of your main profession.

Everybody starts out with the same class title - "Apprentice" - but they
can change it to something more suitable (with the '[Change
Class](Change_Class "wikilink")' command) later. The choice of class
titles is limited by the skills, or the spells, you have practiced.

It should be noted, however, that some [stats](stats "wikilink") are
more suitable for certain classes than others.
