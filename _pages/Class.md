title: "Class"
---

In some other MUD, players are required to pick a "class" when they
create a new character; the character's abilities depend on the class.
MUME works in the opposite way: a character's class depends on whatever
skills the character decided to learn.

At any time, you can type 'change class' and see a list of titles that
match your skills, race, alignment, history, and so on. 'Change class X'
to choose a new class. Your choice only affects where you appear on 'who
warr', 'who cleric'..., and your whois.

When you practice new skills or you gain/lose levels, your class might
be automatically changed, if the one you selected earlier doesn't fit
you anymore.

For example: <nowiki>g \>change class You may choose among the following
titles:

` Priest`
` Scholar`
` Rider`
` Healer`
` Master Healer`
` ...`

\>change class healer Ok.
