**Rope** is useful for leading groups in areas that require the
[Climb](Climb "wikilink") skill. The group leader (i.e. the one who
typed group xxxx ) must have the rope and the others must follow. Trying
to bring too many people at once may cause someone to fall, so shuttling
is the preferred method. All must be trying to climb, even if they are
not skilled at all.

As an alternative, a rope can be **tied** from the top of a cliff, to
make the ascent and descent easier: \>hold rope \>tie rope \[direction\]
To recover a tied rope, just pick it up from where it was tied. Of
course, you can't expect to recover a rope from below: you are trusting
your weight to the knot.
