The Last Homely Home of [Elrond](Elrond "wikilink"), also called
[Rivendell](Rivendell "wikilink"), is well hidden and any visitor has to
**seek** the path leading there.

If you are in the correct spot, 'seek rivendell' may show you the path
to venture - as long as this doesn't endanger the safety of those who
live within the valley.

The ability to be able to seek the hidden city is based on several
things. Of course being an [elf](elf "wikilink") helps, but
[men](man "wikilink"), [hobbits](hobbit "wikilink"), and
[dwarves](dwarf "wikilink") can as well if you are of good enough
[alignment](alignment "wikilink") to do so.
