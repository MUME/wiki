If you would like to have certain items of equipment loaded into your
legend home you will need to also include that in your legend home
request.

Items that are consumable are not allowed, such as oil, lanterns, lembas
wafers as this would provide legend home owners with an advantage in
obtaining these items where they are not provided for others.

All decisions regarding what can or cannot be loaded are subject to
consideration by the V+. To request your items please post your request
or questions on the Legend Home Boards in the various towns allowing
homes.
