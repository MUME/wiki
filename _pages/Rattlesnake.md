\> A diamond-back rattlesnake is coiled here, ready to strike.

\> **look snake**
This long tan snake seems annoyed at your presence, and it lets you know
by
shaking its tail hundreds of times a minute. The sound it produces is
enough to
strike fear into the most seasoned fighter. The black diamond pattern
along its
back make the viper look sinister and dangerous. The most noticeable
thing
about it though, are the twin fangs protruding out of its mouth. Sharp
and
glistening with poison, they would not feel good in your leg.
