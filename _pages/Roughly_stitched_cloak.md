The cloak is partly made from a finely-woven fabric of a deep green
colour and partly made of a fine grey cloth. The two fabrics are of
great workmanship and quality, while the tailor who stitched them
together did a thorough if crude job. The result, while rough, makes
detection of the wearer difficult.

It is a roughly stitched cloak (satisfactory, well-seasoned). It weighs
a couple of pounds. It is starting to look difficult to mend. It fits
you well.
