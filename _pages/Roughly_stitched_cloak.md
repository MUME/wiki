title: Roughly stitched cloak
---

\>**examine cloak**
The cloak is partly made from a finely-woven fabric of a deep green
colour
and partly made of a fine grey cloth. The two fabrics are of great
workmanship
and quality, while the tailor who stitched them together did a thorough
if
crude job. The result, while rough, makes detection of the wearer
difficult.
\>**consider cloak**
It is a roughly stitched cloak.
It weighs a couple of pounds.
