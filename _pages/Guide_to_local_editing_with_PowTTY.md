This guide that will show you how to enable local editing in PowTTY.

**1. Running Powtty**

Download powtty from Elvenrunes and run the program. In the example I
have already run mmapper2 and loaded a map, but that step is unnecessary
for using local editing.

**2. Enabling local editing in the client**

Click the "PowTTY" tab and then enable the local editing option.

**3. Saving the session for future use**

This step is unnecessary as well, here I am changing the host and port
to be directed from Mume towards mmapper2. In the Session tab I then
enter in a session name to save it under and then click "Save" to save
it for later use. Finally I click "Open" to run PowTTY.

**4. Enabling local editing in the game**

Type "change editor" and verify that it is currently set to mume. If
not, then type: change editor mume

**5. Using notepad to edit files**

When you start to write to a board, change your whois, or view a mail
Mume will send the text directly to your client which will then open
notepad. You will be able to change the text file and then click "File",
"Save" to send it back to mume or just close notepad to cancel the
current editing session.

**6. ANSI color**

If you want to learn about creating fancy whoises complete with ANSI
color then I suggest you take a look at my very, very old guide on my
Mume page.
