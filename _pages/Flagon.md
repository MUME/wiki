\> **examine flagon**
The fragrant draught in the flagon has the scent of honey made of many
flowers. It seems cool and refreshing like the water of a clear stream
on a
summer afternoon, and there is an elusive sweetness to its taste, a
faint
flavour of some unfamiliar fruit.
\> **consider flagon**
It is a flagon.
It weighs three pounds.

## Opinions

Tasty mead! Watch out though, drinking it will make you difficult or
impossible to understand. For more information, read about being
[drunk](drunk "wikilink"). Note that while the default liquid in a
flagon will be mead, you can empty it and refill with anything you like.
