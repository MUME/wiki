**Olly** is the owner of Olly's Tavern in [Fornost](Fornost "wikilink").
His tavern can be found just south of the Palisade Gate that leads to
the ruins of Old Fornost.

If one were to be inclined toward thievery, Olly might be able divulge
to you the location, and how to enter, the [Black Dagger
Guild](Black_Dagger_Guild "wikilink"), which is located relatively close
to his tavern. Rumor has it that bribing him (with twice your level in
silver) will loosen his lips enough for him to spill the beans...

`> Olly is standing here, cleaning some cups.`
`> `**`look Olly`**
`> Olly is fairly short for a human, and a bit fat too. Also his hair is `
`retreating from his forehead. This he tries to hide by combing the little hair `
`he still has forward, but of course it only makes things worse. He glares`
`suspiciously at you.`
