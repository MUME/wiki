for some time. This can be used to protect oneself against animals like
wolves and bears and some humanoids. Most dangerous
[mobs](mob "wikilink") can, however, see invisible creatures. So can
experienced players. Low level players can use the spell [Detect
Invisibility](Detect_Invisibility "wikilink").
