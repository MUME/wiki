When fighting [mobs](mob "wikilink") or players in MUME there is a
chance you may inflict or receive **wounds** if the blow is forceful
enough. The resulting bleeding may subsequently make it difficult to
perform common delayed tasks such as [tracking](track "wikilink") or
[casting](cast "wikilink") [spells](spell "wikilink") as the bleeding
will interrupt the action.

You can see your wounds by using the [info](info "wikilink") or
[stat](stat "wikilink") commands. They will show up under the section
*Affected by*. For other players they will be shown when you examine
them.

In increasing order of severity, wounds can be

- light
- deep
- serious
- grievous
- critical

Depending on the severity and location of the wound, the victim may
experience loss of [hit points](hit_points "wikilink"),
[moves](movement_points "wikilink"), [strength](strength "wikilink"),
[endurance](endurance "wikilink"), precision and/or ability to
concentrate.

Although these wounds will heal themselves over time, there are ways to
heal them or at least fasten their healing through:

- applying a [bandage](bandage "wikilink")
- the [Heal](Heal "wikilink") spell
- the [Cure Critic](Cure_Critic "wikilink") spell

Left untreated, wounds may bleed profusely and could cause an untimely
death. They might also become infected.
