**Whetstones** are small hard stones used for sharpening your
[weapon](weapon "wikilink"). To use them:

- You have to either wear the whetstone on your [belt](belt "wikilink")
  or [hold](hold "wikilink") it in your hand.
- You have to '[wield](wield "wikilink")' the weapon you want to mend.
- You then use the command 'whet' to get your weapon back into good
  shape.
- Note that using them requires a great deal of time and energy so you
  will lose [movement points](movement_points "wikilink").
- If no whetstone is available you can certainly [mend](mend "wikilink")
  your weapon at a local weaponsmith's shop.
