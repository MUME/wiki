!# CW\>**examine golden**
This ancient ring, crafted from the finest gold, glows with an eerie red
hue.
As you examine this ring closer, your mind wanders to the blazing fires
of
Mount Doom.
!# CW\>**consider golden**
It is a strange golden ring.
It weighs a few ounces.

== Opinions == This ring is used by [balrog](balrog "wikilink") groups,
and is enchanted to provide the wearer with some protection from fire in
the [balrog](balrog "wikilink")'s mini zone. It is also not possible to
rent or hide the ring.
