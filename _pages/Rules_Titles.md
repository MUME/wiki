title: Rules Titles

[Heroes](Hero "wikilink") and [legends](legend "wikilink") on MUME can
choose their own [title](title "wikilink"). While they have great
freedom in choosing it, a basic rule must be obeyed: a legend's title
must not provide false information. Examples of forbidden titles:

- Wiz the Elven Apprentice of Magic (a legend is not a level 1)

<!-- -->

- Panoramix the White (title reserved to the Tan Istar)

<!-- -->

- Joe the Orc. (when Joe is actually a human)

Also be aware, that all titles should refer to the player in question.
Hence the title "Slash is a jerk" is not acceptable. Also the title
should be something that other players would find acceptable. All titles
must be in English or any of the languages used in Middle Earth.

All titles are subject to veto by the higher [gods](Ainur "wikilink"),
namely Shaper or above.
