title: "Names"
---

MUME's management strongly encourages in-game role-play, though we do
not require it. Therefore, in order to preserve the necessary atmosphere
for those who wish to role-play, we ask that players choose names for
their characters which fit reasonably with the race and subrace of the
character they are playing, as well as with the environment of J.R.R.
Tolkien's Middle-earth.

Players who choose inappropriate names may be asked to select another.
Examples of some inappropriate names are:

Very Bad: Myorc, Manwesucks, Turdhead, Blah, Helpme Bad: Dragontroll,
Elfmage, Skullcrusher the Hobbit Poor: Elrohirr the Dwarf, Griznak the
Elf

Note that anyone creating characters with really bad names (e.g., like
"Youreallgonnadie") just to be annoying will find themselves dealt with
in the harshest manner.

If you are having trouble finding a good name unique to your character
we suggest the following web sites which offer random name generators:
