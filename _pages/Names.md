[MUME](MUME "wikilink")'s management strongly encourages in-game
role-play, though we do not require it. Therefore, in order to preserve
the necessary atmosphere for those who wish to role-play, we ask that
players choose names for their characters which fit reasonably with the
[race](race "wikilink") and subrace of the character they are playing,
as well as with the environment of [J.R.R.
Tolkien](J.R.R._Tolkien "wikilink")'s
[Middle-earth](Middle-earth "wikilink").

Players who choose inappropriate names may be asked to select another.
Examples of some inappropriate names are:

- Very Bad: Myorc, Manwesucks, Turdhead, Blah, Helpme
- Bad: Dragontroll, Elfmage, Skullcrusher the Hobbit
- Poor: Elrohirr the Dwarf, Griznak the Elf

Note that anyone creating characters with really bad names (e.g., like
"Youreallgonnadie") just to be annoying will find themselves dealt with
in the harshest manner.

If you are having trouble finding a good name unique to your character
we suggest the following web sites which offer random name generators:

- [Elvenrunes](http://elvenrunes.mine.nu/):
  - <http://elvenrunes.mine.nu/mume/namegen.html>

<!-- -->

- A name generator for [Black Númenóreans](Black_Númenórean "wikilink"):
  - <http://blackshadowclan.mine.nu/namegen.php>

- An excellent site for Middle-earth languages, including word and name
  meanings:
