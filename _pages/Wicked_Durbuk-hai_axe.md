\> **examine axe**

This axe has an iron head crafted for raw brutality. The attention of
whoever

wrought it was clearly focused on the cruelly-honed edge of the blade
rather

than on the aesthetic form of the head. The axe-head is bound by thick
leather

straps to a dark shaft of twisted wood roughly one and a half feet long.

Mottled black and red stains discolour the otherwise white colour of the

leather.

\> **consider axe**

It is a wicked DurbÅ«k-hai axe.

This cleaving weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is good while attacking and average while defending; its speed is
average, and it inflicts average damage upon hitting.

It weighs five pounds.
