The **tell** command can be used to send a message to another player,
regardless of where they're located. [Sleeping](Sleep "wikilink")
players cannot hear tells.

'tell group' lets you send a message to all the players (but not
mobiles) in your [group](group "wikilink"). Note the messages are all
sent after a delay equal to the time that would take sending individual
messages.

Examples

`> tell CryHavoc You're dead meat - sucker!     [not advised]`
`> tell group Let's meet at Bree`
