The **dodge bonus** (DB%) is a defensive bonus. It is similar to your
[parry bonus](parry_bonus "wikilink") (PB%). There are some notable
differences though.

While your parry bonus is divided by the number of opponents you are
facing in combat, your dodge bonus is not. You will dodge just as well
against 3 enemies as you do against one. While you will only block hits
(parry) from enemies 33% as well when facing 3 enemies.

Your dodge bonus will be lowered if you carry too much weight. The
heavier your [equipment](equipment "wikilink"), the harder it is for you
to dodge.

You can boost your dodge bonus with certain items. There are
[cloaks](cloak "wikilink"), [belts](belt "wikilink"), and
[rings](ring "wikilink") that boost your dodge bonus significantly.
There are also some lighter clothes that provide extra dodge bonuses.

You can improve your dodge bonus rather significantly by learning the
"[Dodge](Dodge "wikilink")" skill. It is considered a
[Thief](Thief "wikilink") skill.

[Mages](Mage "wikilink") can also utilize the
"[shield](Shield_Spell "wikilink")" spell to boost their dodge bonus.
