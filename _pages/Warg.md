**Wargs** are large evil semi-intelligent wolf-hounds. They are probably
descended from Draugluin's [werewolves](werewolf "wikilink"), or of the
wolf-hounds of the line of Carcharoth of the [First
Age](First_Age "wikilink"). Due to their intelligence they often ally
with orcs of the [Tarkhnarb Orc](Tarkhnarb_Orc "wikilink") tribe who
ride them as [mounts](mount "wikilink").

There are several warg mobiles in the game, including [hungry
warg](hungry_warg "wikilink"), [ferocious
warg](ferocious_warg "wikilink") and [huge warg](huge_warg "wikilink").
