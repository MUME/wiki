Wargs are large evil semi-intelligent wolf-hounds. They are probably
descended from Draugluin's [werewolves](werewolf "wikilink"), or of the
wolf-hounds of the line of Carcharoth of the [First
Age](First_Age "wikilink"). Due to their intelligence they often ally
with orcs of the [Tarkhnarb](Tarkhnarb "wikilink") tribe who ride them
as [mounts](mounts "wikilink").
