title: Staff
---

Being a long and robust stick, a **staff** can be used both to strike
down one's enemies and to parry their blows.

In [MUME](MUME "wikilink"), you can use a staff by itself, as a
[two-handed weapon](two-handed_weapons "wikilink"). It does not cause as
much damage as a two-handed sword or a halberd, but it provides a much
better [defence](parry_bonus "wikilink"). Wielded together with another
weapon, the staff is used only to deflect blows: in this case, it works
exactly like a [shield](shield "wikilink").

Like some weapons, MUME staves can be [enchanted](enchant "wikilink") by
magic users. Unlike other weapons, a staff remains bound to the person
who enchanted it, and cannot be used by anyone else.

Staves can also be upgraded, by [embedding](embed "wikilink") several
items in them. If the staff is reinforced with bands of metal, its
defensive properties are boosted. If, on the other side, rare gems are
embedded in an enchanted staff, the staff will enhance its owner's
magical abilities; what kind of enhancement depends on which gem is
embedded. Lastly, a Hero can cast '[Create
Focus](Create_Focus "wikilink")' on his staff, provided it is of the
finest quality. Once the staff is focused it becomes a source of light
as well.
