title: Staff
---

Being a long and robust stick, a staff can be used both to strike down
one's enemies and to parry their blows.

In MUME, you can use a staff by itself, as a two-handed weapon. It does
not cause as much damage as a two-handed sword or a halberd, but it
provides a much better defence. Wielded together with another weapon,
the staff is used only to deflect blows: in this case, it works exactly
like a shield.

Like some weapons, MUME staves can be enchanted by magic users. Unlike
other weapons, a staff remains bound to the person who enchanted it, and
cannot be used by anyone else.

Staves can also be upgraded, by embedding several items in them. If the
staff is reinforced with bands of metal, its defensive properties are
boosted. If, on the other side, rare gems are embedded in an enchanted
staff, the staff will enhance its owner's magical abilities; what kind
of enhancement depends on which gem is embedded. Lastly, a Hero can cast
'create focus' on his staff, provided it is of the finest quality. Once
the staff is focused it becomes a source of light as well.
