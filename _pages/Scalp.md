**Scalping** is a way for members of the evil races to keep track of
whom they have killed. In order to scalp a [corpse](corpse "wikilink"),
simply wield an appropriate tool for the task, and type "scalp corpse".
Only player's corpses may be scalped, and of these, only those of the
higher level characters. Once a corpse has been scalped, this will be
obvious for others to see.
