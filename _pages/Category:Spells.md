Magic on MUME is fairly complex, but also represented in a fairly simple
way. There are many spells, and it takes a long time before a new mage
can master all spells, learn all their uses and so forth.

Attack spells are usually practiced to their maximum, while 'handy'
spells like create food generally only deserve a few practices.
Exceptions to this are the spells you use very often, like 'breath of
briskness', 'armour', and 'shield'.
