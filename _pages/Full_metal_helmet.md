title: Full metal helmet
---

\> **look helmet**
Several metal plates have been skilfully attached to each other,
forming
this helmet. It encloses the head completely, leaving only a small
area
around the eyes and the mouth open. Its top is pointed, allowing it to
fend
off incoming blows to the head. Large vises keep the separate plates
together.
\> **consider helmet**
It is a full metal helmet.
It weighs seven pounds.
