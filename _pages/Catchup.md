Syntax: **catchup** \[<number>\|<name>\]

This command is used to mark all messages on a bulletin board up to the
number given as read. It can only be used in a [room](room "wikilink")
with a bulletin [board](boards "wikilink") (but see also
[news](news "wikilink")).

Mark all messages on a bulletin board up to <number>, or all messages
written by <name>, as read. If you do not specify a parameter, all the
messages are marked as read. If <number> is negative, mark all messages
except the last \<-number\> messages as read.

Example:

` > catchup 14201`
