## Information for Newcomers

PandoraMapper, also know as just pandora started as a little research
project back in the times when [MUME](MUME "wikilink") offered no
support for mappers. It was inspired by Diamoniums MOM Mapper and
Pilsner's ideas of creating a real 3D Map of Arda.

Before the XML support times, Pandora used a quite sophisticated
heuristical tracking engine, based on a state machine with a tiny bit of
scripting available. After XML support made all of the above obsolete,
the non-XML mode was removed and replaced with an XML parser.

## Main features

- Designed for speed and stability.

Exactly in this order. Everything was designed with 2 things in mind.
Mapper shall not slow down your "link". even by a few milliseconds.
Mapper shall always know your position.

Though given you really need a more or less modern 3D card. (Geforce
5200 is enough, 6600GT is an overkill)

- Solid stability in playing mode.

By now means is mapper allowed to crash while you are playing. For me,
it never crashed in the last 2 years. However, the stability is not
granted when you start editing the map. It's strongly adviced to save
often.

- 3D Map and full freedom of view. (paning, zooming, rotating)

- Z-Mud alike map

No more walls, but a lot of connections between rooms as lines and
similar.
