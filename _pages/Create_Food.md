title: Create Food
---

**Create food** is a level 3 [cleric](cleric "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink") that creates a magic mushroom. Food can also
be bought in [shops](shops "wikilink"), found at many places, or created
by [butchering](butcher "wikilink") animals. It can however be too heavy
to carry several day rations around. Thus, most casters (both clerics
and [mages](mage "wikilink")) like to spend a few practice sessions on
it.
