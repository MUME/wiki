Characters of [level](level "wikilink") 26 and above are called
'legends'. Advancement as a legend is ten times slower than as a
non-legend.

The higher level legends (level 30 or greater) of the races of the Free
Peoples of Arda may buy a 'house' known as a 'legend home' which they
can then create using the standard room creation commands. There are
many special rules regarding this, and these may be obtained from the
help files and from the responsible Ainur.
