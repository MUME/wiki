title: Idle

When a player has been away from the game for a long enough time they
will lapse into a state of semi-consciousness and fade away into the
void.

These players are idle, and are identified by the word (Idle) next to
their name in the who list. Idle players are able to see tells directed
to them, however since they are away from the game for whatever reason
they most likely will not return your tell.

Setting up your linkdrop can enable you to remain unidle.
