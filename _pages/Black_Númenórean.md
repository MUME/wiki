The origin of the first **Black Númenóreans** is in the latter half of
the Second Age. Lovers of power over lesser men, these Númenóreans
became corrupted by [Sauron](Sauron "wikilink"), coming to hate all good
peoples. They settled in [Middle Earth](Middle_Earth "wikilink") mainly
in Umbar and surrounding coastal regions.

After Sauron's downfall at the beginning of the Third Age, the
bloodlines of these Númenórean descendants mixed with other peoples,
especially the Haradrim over which they had dominion. During the first
millenia of the age, they proved strong enemies of the Dúnedain of
Gondor, but were permanently scattered when Umbar was taken in TA 933,
and when the subsequent siege was broken in TA 1050.

As men, they are imposing in their height, with angular features. They
also make strong warriors, proud of their heritage. Thus they still
retain many of the ancient characteristics of the Edain, like their
cousins the [Dúnedain](Dúnedain "wikilink").

## MUME BNs

Mume Black Númenóreans are wanderers from the far southern lands. They
are allied with [orcs](orc "wikilink") and [trolls](troll "wikilink")
who directly or indirectly serve the will of
[Sauron](Sauron "wikilink").

BN's have a number of penalties:

- They can't become immortal.
- They generally have worse stats than other [men](man "wikilink").
- They have no cities in which to [rent](rent "wikilink"). However, they
  can [camp](camp "wikilink") outside and often do not pay rent.
- They must wander in search of those
  [guildmasters](guildmaster "wikilink") of theirs who have made the
  trip to Eriador. No [warrior](warrior "wikilink") guildmasters have
  ever been found, so their [weapon](weapon "wikilink")
  [skills](skill "wikilink") are limited.
- When they die they return to a secret place and
  [pray](pray "wikilink") for a new life. Where they find themselves
  afterwards, only the [Ainur](Ainur "wikilink") know.
- They can suffer from [depression](depression "wikilink").
- A BN will see free peoples by name or race only eg. \*an
  [Elf](Elf "wikilink")\*. They can however see and group both orcs and
  trolls, thus proving to be valuable aides.
- BNs are ineffective vs. [Lightning Bolt](Lightning_Bolt "wikilink")
  (they take extra damage).

## An Excerpt from Vecna's Guide for Black Númenóreans

"Let me introduce you to your selected race. You will be hunted, killed,
and overkilled constantly. You will suffer from depression, an ailment
caused by either dying, (mobkilled, playerkilled, or falling into a
death trap) or backfiring your spells. Your willpower and your maximum
mana will be reduced during depression. You will have no hometown (orcs
have New Orc Caves, and Trolls have Warrens - both places are aggressive
to you). You will have no shops. Your stats will be worse than the free
races. You will not have a focused staff. Your skills will be lower
percentages. Your spells will cause less damage or effectiveness. Your
spells will be slower than other races.

But you must be cunning. You must be evil. You must be cruel. You must
have the element of surprise. Your true power will be in your ability to
trick your enemies. And most of all you must be ready for anything."
