Every once in a while MUME will need to **reboot** to incorporate new
[features](features "wikilink") as well as to change or update certain
game functions. A reboot usually takes about 30 seconds.

Periodically, the game is also rebooted to "clean up" the world. Some
features of the game are not well adapted to the game never being
restarted.

Any [mount](mount "wikilink") you were riding/leading at the time of
reboot will disappear so it might be a good idea to
[rent](rent "wikilink") it at your local [stable](stable "wikilink").
Also, if you do not plan on coming back to the game immediately after
the reboot be aware that the cost of renting your characters outside of
an [inn](inn "wikilink") is considerably higher.

During a reboot the world will return to its default status.
[Doors](Door "wikilink") will close; hostile
[creatures](mobile "wikilink") will pop up; anything that you may have
left on the ground (and possibly some rare [items](item "wikilink") you
may have acquired) will vanish forever. Contrarily to what happens
during a crash, after a reboot you reappear wherever you were - or in
the close proximity. So, even if you do not want to rent, it is wise to
move to a safe place before MUME reboots.

The [Aratar](Ainur#Aratar "wikilink") can reboot the game at any time
and for any reason, so quit bitching about it.
