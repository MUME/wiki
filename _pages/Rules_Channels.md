Each communication channel on MUME has a different purpose, please use
them appropriately.

[Shout](Shout "wikilink"): it is reserved for short, rare, very
important messages. Since it is impossible to turn it off, use this
channel very carefully.

[Narrate](Narrate "wikilink"): A generic communication channel, which
can be used also for subjects which are not a question of life or death.
It is supposed to be used for game talk and _only_ in english.

[Sing](Sing "wikilink"): A channel that can be used for any kind of
information, a gossip channel.

[Tell](Tell "wikilink"): One-to-one communication, in any language you
feel like.

[Say](Say "wikilink"): Used to talk to all people in one room, this
communication should be in English -- unless everybody in the room feels
OK about other languages being spoken.

Yell: since it can be heard both by players on your side and on the
opposite side, you must be careful when you yell. Going outside the
Warrens and yelling that XYZ the Legend is alone, wounded, icy and
exhausted at the Small Stream Crossing at midnight isn't good for your
health, especially if what you yelled is true.

You can use a pet or a charmed mobile to narrate, but you should be very
careful not to cause spam.

Examples:

- Bilbo buys ten dogs and makes them narrate 'Woof!'. This is bad.
- Bilbo charms Lobelia (unlikely :\>) and commands her to sing,
  once,"*'happy birthday dear Bilbo*". No problem.
