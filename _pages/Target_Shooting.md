title: "Target Shooting"
---

In some places where archery is practiced, targets are placed for
archers to use. If you are at such a shooting range, with the correct
equipment, you can fire at the targets. 'SHOOT <target>' is the command
used to fire a missile weapon.

Targets are made of soft and arrow-safe material, so missiles should not
break.

During archery contests, someone usually walks closer to the target to
spot for the archers. To commence spotting, type 'SPOT TARGET' and
'STOP' to cease, or simply walk away.

If you examine or look at the target, you can clearly see where on the
target the missiles hit.

Recover will work as usual and only remove the missiles you shot.
