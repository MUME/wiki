title: Call
---

Most fortified [towns](town "wikilink") on Arda close their **gates** at
night. If you are a [citizen](citizen "wikilink") and you are outside a
closed gate, you can **call** the gatekeeper and ask him to let you in.
You can also 'call close' to ask the gatekeeper to close the gate once
you left the town.

If, on the other hand, you are inside the gate, you can ask to open or
close the gates (for instance, '[say](say "wikilink") open'). If the
door is hidden, you have to 'say open <doorname>'.

Most gatekeepers will not open the gates for you if you are not a
citizen.

In some towns the gatekeepers are not particularly scrupulous and may
allow you to get in or out for a **bribe**. To bribe them, type, for
example, 'bribe 5 [gold](gold "wikilink")' in the gatekeeper's
[room](room "wikilink") or on the other side of the gate.

Gates may also be found in less civilised parts of
[Arda](Arda "wikilink"). These will open only if the inhabitants of the
area behind the gate are friendly towards you.

There are also special kind of 'non-gates' that react to call, such as
the ladder at the rent place south of Lorien that can be called to be
lowered.

Another use of the 'call' command is to call an
[Eagle](Eagle "wikilink")
