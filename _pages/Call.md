title: "Call"
---

Most fortified towns on Arda close their gates at night. If you are a
citizen and you are outside a closed gate, you can CALL the gatekeeper
and ask him to let you in. You can also 'call close' to ask the
gatekeeper to close the gate once you left the town.

If, on the other hand, you are inside the gate, you can ask to open or
close the gates (for instance, \`say open'). If the door is hidden, you
have to \`say open <doorname>'.

Most gatekeepers will not open the gates for you if you are not a
citizen.

In some towns the gatekeepers are not particularly scrupulous and may
allow you to get in or out for a bribe. To bribe them, type, for
example, 'bribe 5 gold' in the gatekeeper's room or on the other side of
the gate.

Gates may also be found in less civilised parts of Arda. These will open
only if the inhabitants of the area behind the gate are friendly towards
you.
