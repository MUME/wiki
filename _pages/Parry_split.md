title: "Parry split"
---

Parry splitting was perhaps first described in Petrel's book '[Newbie
Guide to the MUME Combat
System](https://tabris23.tripod.com/books/oocbook03.txt)', available in
all good [libraries](libraries "wikilink"). Essentially everyone's parry
bonus is split between all the opponents attacking them in melee. The
exact formula is unknown, so it may not be equal, and levels may have
something to do with it, but it is generally very effective in any case.
