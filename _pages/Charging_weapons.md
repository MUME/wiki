## Charge

(Warrior skill) (Weapon Class) \[Delayed Command\]

To charge successfully, you need good riding skill, a horse and a lance.
Charging only works outdoors on flat terrain, and a successful charge
will inflict major damage on the victim; it will do more damage if you
charge for a longer distance. You can not charge once you are already
engaged in combat.

Example:

`  > charge morthan`
