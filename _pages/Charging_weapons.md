**Charge** is a [warrior](warrior "wikilink") [skill](skill "wikilink")
and [weapon](weapon "wikilink") class. To charge successfully, you need
good [riding](ride "wikilink") skill, a horse and a lance. Charging only
works outdoors on flat [terrain](terrain "wikilink"), and a successful
charge will inflict major damage on the victim; it will do more damage
if you charge for a longer distance. You can not charge once you are
already engaged in combat.

Example:

\> **charge morthan**

NOTE: This skill is considered useless.
