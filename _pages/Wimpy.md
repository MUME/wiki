Usage: CHANGE WIMPY <value>

When you are in a fight and your hit points go below your wimpy value,
you will almost immediately attempt to flee out of the fight. Then,
successive flee attempts are automatically scheduled until you get out
of the fight somehow, or reset the wimpy value.

You can flee due to autowimpy while bashed or otherwise stunned, but in
this case on every attempt you get a saving throw due to your condition.
The more damaged you are, the more chances you have to get an
'adrenaline rush' and thus try to flee.

Use CHANGE WIMPY without argument to avoid fleeing due to autowimpy.

You can't flee at all if your mood is berserk.
