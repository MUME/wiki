## Hide

(Thief Skill)

Syntax: hide <effort>, one of quickly/fast/normally/carefully/thoroughly

When you type hide there is a chance that you hide in the room. If
hidden, nothing can be done to you until you are found, or you stop
hiding. You stop hiding if you move; you can be found if someone
searches for you, or if you perform most actions (for example if you
speak). Other people may or may not notice that someone is hidden,
depending on a number of different factors (skills, spells and
attributes), but won't be able to do anything to you until you are found
(area-wide attacks, like earthquake, are an exception).

It is easier to hide in some places, e.g. forests. The more carefully
you hide, the better your chances of success and the better you will be
hidden.

If someone or something is looking at you while you hide, they will know
where you are hidden; however, characters who are not in the same place
will not be able to see you. The same happens if you speak aloud while
hidden: any bystanders will learn of your hiding place, but you will
remain hidden to everyone else.

Attacks from hiding have the benefit of surprise. On the other hand, if
you are discovered without realizing it, you become vulnerable to a
surprise counterattack yourself.

Example:

`  > hide carefully`
`  (wait a bit)`
`  OK.`
`  > (you wait for 2 mins and remain hidden for 2 mins)`
`  > say hello`
`  > (Everyone in the room now knows where you are hidden)`

HIDE <object>

You can try to hide an object in a room. This object will stay there
unless discovered by another player. Hidden objects won't survive
crashes and reboots. It is said that they can be stolen from time to
time by evil spirits, but nobody knows for sure.
