Usage: [change](change "wikilink") **spam** \[on\|off\]

Spam is a familiar problem with net-traffic and depending upon your
situation in the game, can be totally disabling. To combat this you can
use the command 'Spam' to toggle on or off (default) the NoSpam mode. We
encourage everyone to use this 'superbrief' mode (so type 'spam' once).

What it does:

- Won't show [room](room "wikilink") descriptions on
  '[look](look "wikilink")'. They are still available typing the command
  '[examine](examine "wikilink")'.
- Won't show [ridden](ride "wikilink") mounts in a room (since they are
  already shown with their rider description). Mounts are shown on
  'examine'.
- Missed fight messages are not sent EXCEPT the message of the first
  attack.
- While moving with your [group](group "wikilink"), you will only see
  the leader move (the one you are following) not the entrances/leaves
  of all the group.
