\> **examine mace**

It is large and heavy, and its head bears a dozen sharp, iron spikes.

It appears as though it was made for the purpose of shredding metal and

bone alike.

\> **consider mace**

It is a cruelly-spiked mace.

This crushing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is good while attacking and poor while defending; its speed is
average, and it inflicts average damage upon hitting.

It weighs four pounds.
