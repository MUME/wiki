\>**examine bone**
The rib-bone is dry and well preserved, as magic was holding it together
until
recently. It is sharp-pointed and can be used as a weapon, but a
rather

aura
fences it, as if it was already partially in the world of the Shadows.
\>**consider bone**
It is a rib-bone of a skeleton.
It weighs half a pound.
