**Bandage** is a [ranger](general "wikilink") [skill](skill "wikilink")
that allows one to give first aid to someone suffering from different
types of [wounds](wound "wikilink").

Note that one can't really heal a person with this skill, it can only
prevent further blood loss from the wounds, assist the wounds in
recovering naturally, and prevent those wounds from becoming infected.

It is possible to increase the severity of the wound or even kill the
person being bandaged if the skill level is not high enough.

Trying to cure an already bound wound will remove the old bandage first.

Syntax:


*bandage <victim>*

*bandage* (to bandage your own wounds)

Once bandaged, a wound will heal faster.

A bandaged wound will show up as '(bandaged)' with a quality modifier.
The quality of the bandage will influence the healing speed.

The conditions of the bandage will deteriorate with time, so it is a
good idea to replace old bandages from time to time.
