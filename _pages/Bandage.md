## Bandage

(Ranger Skill) \[Delayed Command\]

Syntax: bandage <victim>

This allows you to give first aid to someone suffering from different
types of wounds. But care must be taken, you can damage, even kill the
person you are trying to help by trying to apply your skill if you are
not experienced enough.

Note that you can't really heal a person with this skill, you can only
prevent further blood loss from the wounds, assist the wounds in
recovering naturally, and prevent those wounds from becoming infected.

Trying to cure an already bound wound will remove the old bandage first.

Example:

\> bandage Shathur
