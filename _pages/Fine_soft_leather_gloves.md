title: Fine soft leather gloves
---

CW\>**examine** gloves
These gloves have been constructed from a high quality leather,
lined with fine rabbit fur to offer comfort as well as protection.
CW\>**consider** gloves
They are a fine pair of soft leather gloves (worn, well-seasoned).
They weigh about one pound.
They fit you well.

## Opinion

Loads in Dunland on a mobile called Mab, they give an offensive bonus
slightly higher compared to other leather gloves.
