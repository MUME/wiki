\> **look cap**
The cap is little more than a thin piece of fabric, which has been
shaped
into the simplest headwear. The material is dark, and a little dirty,
so
it is hard to see the pattern, but it appears to be a simple check.
The
rim has been stiffened slightly, so that it might protect the wearer's
eyes from the sun.
\> **consider cap**
It is a soft cloth cap'.
It weighs a few ounces.
