title: Cover

**Cover** is a command used to temporarily block the light from a light
source from escaping.

'cover' doesn't act as a toggle: to uncover a
[lantern](lantern "wikilink") after it has been covered, you have to
'uncover' it. 'dim' is a synonym for 'cover'.

At the moment, both 'cover' and 'uncover' require an argument - the name
of the light source you want to cover or uncover.

Example:

`> cover lantern`
`> uncover lantern`
