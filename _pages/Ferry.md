title: "Ferry"

Ferries are a comfortable way of crossing a body of water when a bridge
is not available. There are several ferries on Arda; some are quite
large and charge passengers for passage; others are hand-operated by the
user and free.

In order to start a trip by ferry, use the '[Board](Board "wikilink")'
command. When you reach your destination, you might have to
'[Leave](Leave "wikilink")' the ship, or you might disembark
automatically -- it depends on the particular ferry you are using.
