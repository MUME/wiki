**Ferries** are a comfortable way of crossing a [body of
water](waterways "wikilink") when a bridge is not available or using
[boats](boat "wikilink") is impractical. There are several ferries on
[Arda](Arda "wikilink"); some are quite large and charge passengers for
passage; others are hand-operated by the user and free.

In order to start a trip by ferry, use the '[Board](Board "wikilink")'
command. When you reach your destination, you might have to
'[Leave](Leave "wikilink")' the ship, or you might disembark
automatically -- it all depends on the particular ferry you are using.

A special case is the Anduin ferry which is entered and exited via
directions and operated by saying 'sail'. If it currently is at the
opposite bank, you can use 'call ferry' to make it come over.
