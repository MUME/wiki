The **shout** command can be used to give a message to everyone in the
game, regardless of whether they want to hear it or not. This should be
a very rarely used command, and abuse of it will probably lead to many
of your communication commands being removed, or worse.

For telling rumours and tales to everyone, use the
[Narrate](Narrate "wikilink") command which can be turned off by those
who are not interested.

The dark side cannot hear whitie shouts, and vice versa.

NOTE: Since the '[pray](pray "wikilink")' command got implemented as a
way of communicating with the gods, it would be advised that you only
use the shout command as a last resort. If the problem is extremely
serious, and you do not get any response when praying, then you may use
the shout command.

Example:

`> shout Confirmed bug found, can a V+ come here please?`
