title: Black cape

\> **examine cape**

This cape is very dark black and appears to be made of some fabric which
you

cannot identify. You can see faint indications of some markings and
symbols

on the fabric. They are silvery in colour but they are so thin you
cannot see

their overall pattern. If there is any meaning in the markings, it is
unlikely

you can figure it out.

\> **consider cape**
