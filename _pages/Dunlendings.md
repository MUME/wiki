title: Dunlendings
---

(Dn."Daen Lintis") A rugged race of commen men who largely migrated out
of the White Mountains in the Second Age. Dunlendings often have a
medium or stocky build, sparse brown hair and tanned or ruddy
complexions averaging 5'10" for men and 5'6 for women.

Dunlendings as a people are largely mountain dwellers or hill loving
herders and hunters who jealously guard their independance and are often
at odds with their neighbours the Rohirrim.

Dunlendings exist in tribal collections, each with their own customs and
territories. Inter-tribal raiding and conflict is common and Dunland can
be a turbulent and dangerous area.
