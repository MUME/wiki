The **Dunlendings** (Dn."Daen Lintis") are a rugged race of common
[men](men "wikilink") who largely migrated out of the White Mountains in
the Second Age. Dunlendings often have a medium or stocky build, sparse
brown hair and tanned or ruddy complexions averaging 5'10" for men and
5'6 for women.

Dunlendings as a people are largely mountain dwellers or hill loving
herders and hunters who jealously guard their independence and are often
at odds with their neighbours the [Rohirrim](Rohirrim "wikilink").

Dunlendings exist in tribal collections, each with their own customs and
territories. Inter-tribal raiding and conflict is common and Dunland can
be a turbulent and dangerous area.
