\> A huge stag with a great span of antlers is warily browsing on the
vegetation.
\> **look stag**
This stag is far larger than any of the common elk or red deer. His body
and
head are shaped like a huge deer rather than the ungainly elk, but his
antlers have a shape all their own. Long stems of bone support great
circular plates with perhaps 10 tines each several feet on each side of
his
head.
