Gives the approximate current 'game time'. This can only be guessed at
without a clock, and only if you are outside. Certain things in the game
depend on this particular notion of time; the opening hours of the
shops, for example. This will also give the current real time (Greenwich
Mean Time)

Note that one 'tick' is one game hour, and there is usually around a
minute between ticks (i.e. MUME time runs 60 times faster than real
time).
