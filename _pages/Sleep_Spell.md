**Sleep** is a level 14 [mage](mage "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). If successfully [cast](cast "wikilink") on a
creature, it will fall asleep and be unable to awake for some time.
Sleep is primarily used to deactivate tough
[mobiles](mobile "wikilink"). It can also be used on players. Use on
players is uncommon since it is such a long casting time, unless they
[store](store "wikilink") it. Many characters also have a good will
defence to protect them.
