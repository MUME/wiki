title: "State"

Item damage has internally been represented with two values Item state,
and item permanent damage (or age). The permanent damage and item state
will be shown to players like this:

<nowiki>g State, from best to worst: Permanent damage/age, best to
worst: flawless new well-maintained fresh satisfactory seasoned used
well-seasoned worn aged neglected old marred hoary unavailing timeworn
deteriorating age-old worn out antiquated

</pre>

Now, this is important: ONLY THE STATE decides how good the item is. The
older an item is, the quicker its state will go down though. So - a
(flawless, new) sword, is just as good as a (flawless, old) sword.

Items that are timeworn or older cannot be mended in any way, and have
little value.
