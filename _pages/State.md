Item damage has internally been represented with two values, item
**state** and item permanent damage (or age). The permanent damage and
item state will be shown to players like this:

State, from best to worst: Permanent damage/age, best to worst: flawless
new well-maintained fresh satisfactory seasoned used well-seasoned worn
aged neglected old marred hoary unavailing timeworn deteriorating
age-old worn out antiquated

Now, this is important: *Only* the state decides how good the item is.
The older an item is, the quicker its state will go down though. So - a
(flawless, new) sword, is just as good as a (flawless, old) sword.

Items that are timeworn or older cannot be [mended](mend "wikilink") in
any way, and have little value.
