## Statistics

!# CW\>**examine rock**
This rock, not much larger than a small hand, appears too twisted and
convoluted to be natural. Veins of a silvery metallic substance glisten
on
the black surface, like liquid ice. Periodically the rock seems to
pulsate,
as if the insides were full of a hidden power waiting for its time to
break
free.

!# CW\>**consider rock**
It is a twisted rock fragment.
It weighs a couple of pounds.

## Opinions

Rocks are used to the same effect as the spell ['break
door'](Break_Door "wikilink"), but they do have a few unique properties
as well. Rocks get heavy, although they are useful and having a couple
on your person at all times it often necessary if you are to survive
traps or overkillers. If someone throws a rock, any other rock on any
person in the same room has a chance of exploding, causing some damage
to the person holding them.
