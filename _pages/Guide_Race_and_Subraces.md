Guide Race and Subraces

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

""In the last years of Denethor I the race of uruks, black orcs of great
strength, first appeared out of Mordor, and in 2475 they swept across
Ithilien and took Osgiliath."

Appendix A, JRRT, Return of the King

This guide is all about races and subraces in MUME.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at: <https://mume.org/help/help_index>

**Bold** words can be looked up in the games help files. Like **help
race**.

First the playable races of the Free People of the West will be listed.
Then the Followers of Sauron.

Each race will also be broken down by subrace.

## **Very Important Help Files**

The following help files should be read to make this guild very useful.
Each of them has alot of information about all the race/subraces in the
game.

Also each race and subrace have their own helpfiles for more details.
For example:

`help broadbeam, help stoor, help beorning, help hill troll, help zaugruz, help rohirrim, help half elf`

So please read the following help files:

- Help Race
- Help Age
- Help Terrain
- Help Language

## **Which Classes for Which Races?**

The full and true answer is pretty much any combination of race and
class you want to play is allowed, and mostly playable. If you want to
play an dwarf thief or hobbit mage, please do so! Just know, there is a
chance that combination might not be quite as min/max as a class of some
other races for all tasks.

Some classes or combos 'pair' or 'fit' with some races or subraces
better then others.

Here is a brief list of examples that over all are reliable:

- Dwarves: any type of warrior, tanky warrior, maybe defense warrior,
  hit/bash warrior, make tolerable clerics. Even cleric/warrior combos.

<!-- -->

- Elves: really any type of caster, mage, cleric, mage/cleric combos,
  decent scouts/thieves, Silvans make pretty good scouts/archers. Also
  useable defense warrior.

<!-- -->

- Half-elves: Clerics or mages or cleric/mage combos are pretty good
  choices.

<!-- -->

- Hobbits: thieves, scouts, and archers! Maybe some warrior/scout
  combos. Maybe a tolerable cleric. Stoors can make a useable warrior.

<!-- -->

- Men: No real limitations any class or combo is playable, Dundain make
  good defense warriors

# **Forces of the Free People**

The Free People of the West are made up of various groups of subraces
coming from dwarves, elves, half-elves, hobbits, and men. Generally in
the game most characters that are of the Free People are good, and you
probably should not kill them. The only common except to this rule are
men that are bandits, robbers, ruffians, muggers, footpads, thieves,
smugglers, outlaws, and assassins. And crazed dwarves.

### Beornings and Bears

There is quite a difference between playing a Beorning man and Bear. So
some of those differences will be listed here.

You use the **metamorph** command to change into bear form. You use the
**return** command to switch back to a Beorning man form.

You can very easily fail the metamorph attempt. Failing metamorphs can
cost some mana.

Your chances to metamorph improve as you:

- level up (large factor)
- are at full mana, it costs mana to attempt to metamorph
- try at night
- if the moon is out, or moon phase closer to full moon
- the closer you are to the Carrock near Ingrove (large factor)

Your duration of staying in bear form is somewhat random, but duration
greatly increases with those same factors. When the duration ends, you
simply return back to Beorning man form.

When you return to man form, you are at zero mana.

Beornings and Bears have the following features:

- Forage. When a Bear forages, he/she will search the surrounding area
  for anything edible or drinkable water. Foraging is only possible when
  metamorphed into a Bear.
- This is basically a create food/water spell for a Bear that costs no
  mana and no pracs and has a small delay. You can't do it in cities.
- Beornings start the game with a 25% bonus in the Wilderness skill.
  This bonus does not make practicing Wilderness less effective.
- Beornings are empowered by the presence of powerful, friendly bears.
  Which means if there is a bear in your room and is higher level then
  you, you gain an OB bonus.
- They can bash without a shield, just using their great strength, large
  size, and bulk.
- They have the ability to see in the dark without a light source.
- Bears can butcher corpses with out a knife, they can butcher with
  their claws.
- Bears can decapitate corpses, just like Sauron's forces can.
- Beornings get a -5 penalty to PB in man form, and as a Bear cannot
  parry blows at all, 0% PB.
- Bears have high DB but no absorb and cannot wear any armour.
- Bears cannot ride any mounts at all. But they can still lead mounts
  around and group them. Or saddle and unsaddle their mounts.
- In bear form, they cannot cast spells at all and have no mana. When
  returning from bear form you have zero mana.
- In bear form, Beorning mobs and most types of bears are not aggressive
  to you.
- In bear form, they can narrate so others can see the communication.
  They can only see Beornings and Bears in bear form with Who command.

### Dunadans

- Dunadans have a natural sensitivity to evil, and have a natural
  passive ability like the Detect Evil spell.
- This is a permanent Detect Evil effect that is always up and active,
  it will look something like this: A black bear is sleeping here (red
  aura).
- Dunadans are friends of the Elves. They can pray to Rivendell without
  previously visiting it and will be welcomed in Lorien with
  considerably less effort than other men.
- Dunadans are master swordsmen, and are able to defend themselves
  better with bladed weapons.
- The PB bonus is from slashing and piercing weapons.
- The PB bonus is based off of mood: aggressive +1 PB, brave +2 PB,
  normal +3 PB, prudent +4 PB, wimpy +5 PB
- Dunadans have a natural affinity for Leadership skill of +25%. This
  does not affect practicing the skill.
- Dunadans are natural teachers. They will share a portion of their
  knowledge in ranger skills with their followers who are not as
  proficient as they are.
- Dunadans grant a small bonus to % in some Ranger skills for anyone
  following them. Being grouped or not grouped does NOT matter, its
  following that matters.
- Bandage, Climb, Swim, Wilderness
- Dunadans are excellent trackers. They will get a bonus to their
  ability to track as they become more well-rounded rangers. This does
  not affect practicing the skill.
- As you practice other Ranger guild skills, your % in Track skill will
  slowly go up, without ever practicing Track.
- Basically you get a few % in Track free, if you really pump up ranger
  skills, it's worth about 2-3 pracs. Here's an example:

Skill Sessions Knowledge Difficulty Advice
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Awareness 24/22 95% Normal You should be teaching me! Bandage 10/10 69%
Easy You know as much as I do Climb 10/ 3 101% Very easy You should be
teaching me! Command 24/ 8 95% Normal You should be teaching me!

  and riding.

  skill. This bonus does not make practicing less effective.

# **Minions of Sauron**

Those that follow Sauron are not very restricted on which mobs they can
kill and not have to pay consequences to them later. Over all they have
generally worse stats then the other races and other penalties as well
(such as negatives to playing while in sunlight or horrible depression).

They also tend to have less cities, towns, shops, and settlements and
resources that their side can use.

Except for Zorcs, they can all do a quest to be come a citizen of the
Morgundul Encampment in Dol Guldur.

  almost all plains, hills, and forest rooms in the game. The cost to
  rent is usually zero.

  made the trip to Eriador, making BN guild masters the most difficult
  to find in the game.

  about 12-14 different zones in the game, generally in the East and
  outdoors.

  reduces your max mana. Depression can take over 2 MUME days to fade.
  Game message is "Your heart feels lighter."
- You can get long lasting depression from dying, and shorter depression
  from backfiring a spell. Also slows mana regen some.
- They will see free peoples by name or race only eg. \*an Elf\*. They
  can however see and group both orcs and trolls, thus proving to be
  valuable aides.

  chance to backfire spells when under the Necromancer's darkness.

There are 3 different orc tribes that are playable. Tarkhnarb orcs,
Morruhk-hai orcs, and Zaugurz. There are actually a few other orc tribes
in the game, but they are all NPCs or mobs. The Tharhnarb orcs and
Morruhk-hai orcs are allied tribes, and share the same towns and guild
masters. Zaugurz orcs have their own town and guildmasters.

- They may not become immortal.
- They generally have worse stats than the other races.
- Sunlight affects them badly (much lower bonuses, use movement points
  much faster, increased difficulty in spell casting).
- Sunlight gives a debuff of -30 OB% and -30% DB.

- When casting in Sunlight you get this message "Struggling against the
  Yellow Face, you try to concentrate..."

- Orcs are allegedly more resistant to poison then other races.
- Orcs are allegedly more resistant to disease then other races.
- All orcs can **drain** the blood from corpses to drink and fill skins
  with. Blood acts as both food and drink.

### Tarkhnarb

- Tarkhnarb Orcs mix Orkish herblores with an increased proficiency
  equal to three herbal kit upgrades.
- This includes: Dark Draught, Orc-draught, Orc-Balm
- Tarkhnarb Orcs are tunnel born and have a natural affinity to climbing
  in caves, tunnels, and other familiar terrain.
- When a Tarkhnarb Orc forms a link to the wraith-world through raise
  dead, it increases their mana regeneration and sharpens their
  awareness. The effect is slightly different for shadows and wargs.
- Under stat this is called -shadow-link. It grants a +5% bonus to
  Awareness skill and a small boost to mana regen.
- When Tarkhnarb orcs or Morruhk orcs group, they gain a small OB bonus.
- The OB bonus when grouping seems to be +4% to +5% OB per orc. Tested
  it for a group of 3 Orcs.
- Tarkhnarb Orcs' desire for bloodshed rises when encountering the
  forces of the West.
- Tarkhnarb Orcs start with a citizenship to Goblin Town, also known as
  New Orc Caves, or NOC.
- Tarkhnarb Orcs can ride brown wolves or hungry wargs.

### Morruhk-hai

  likely to fall from their mounts, and their mounts are less likely to
  refuse.

- Bloodlust: Encountering and fighting the Free People will temporarily
  increase their tracking skill.

  it for a group of 3 Orcs.

  the races. Be ready to die.
- It is rumoured that the Morruhk-hai have a special breed of wargs they
  ride into battle that will not carry any other Orc: Slavering wargs.
- Certain wargs will come when called by a Morruhk-hai. These are called
  slavering wargs. You can get one at the Morruhk caves with good bash
  or pick.
- Morrukh Orcs can ride brown wolves, hungry wargs, or slavering wargs.
- Slavering and dreadful wargs will come when called by a Morruhk-hai.
  This functions just like calling a warhorse.
- Their dreadful wargs can bash doors when called and have a higher
  chance of listening to their commands.
- They can rent the slavering wargs in the Orc Caves at the Kennels
  south of the Great Goblin in Goblin Town.
- Slavering wargs have decent climb and swim and can follow into many
  areas most mounts cannot go. Easily the most flexible mount in the
  game.
- Morruhk Orcs can get a citizenship for free if they survive long
  enough to make it to Goblin Town, or NOC.

### Zaugurz

The Zaugruz orc tribe is on a side all it's own, and is at war with
everyone else. Including Sauron's other forces.

- Their only town is Zorc caves, north of Goblin Town or NOC (New Orc
  Caves).
- They are able to move through snow more easily.
- This basically means Zorc feet are 'effective vs cold', or then can
  move around as if always having the effects of snowshoes worn.

  injuries, allowing them to fight with reduced hindrance.

  stats and abilities.

  effects, showcasing an unwavering determination to crush their
  enemies.

  \*an Elf\*, \*Snarf the Orc\*), even other orc tribes.
- Zaugurz orcs start with a citizenship to Zaugurz Orc Caves.

## **Trolls**

- Stat: Str +7, Int -3, Wis -3, Dex -3, Con +4, Wil -3, Per -2

Trolls can make some of the most effective Damage, Hitter, or DPS
warriors in the entire game, or can be good Tank warriors as well. They
can even become useable tracking warriors. And they can ignore MANY of
the issues that other races have to deal with, such as poisons, disease,
wounds, worrying about food, etc... But for all of this power they have,
they can suffer one of the greatest penalties in the entire game,
**Sundeath**.

- They may not become immortal.
- They cannot cast spells at all and have no mana. They cannot practice
  mage or cleric spells at all.
- They have access to no shops.
- They do heavy damage barehanded.
- This grants access to a special Warrior skill called Unarmed Combat.
  They can attack and hit with just claws for decent damage.
- They have natural armour due to their thick hide. But can still wear
  other armour that fits them.
- They can **bash** without a shield, just using their great strength,
  large size, and bulk.
- They are immune to all poisons and diseases.
- They do not bleed from wounds at all. Wounds still impact and lower
  their stats.
- Troll wounds never worsen past (dirty), are never (suppurating), and
  never worsen to a deeper type of wound.
- They can eat almost any item in the game and entire corpses. Eating
  corpses fills them up for a couple of days.
- Eating a corpse also fills up your drink from the blood within the
  corpse. It's drinking and eating at the same time.
- They cannot ride or lead any mounts at all.
- They can not practice these Ranger skills: Bandage, Command,
  Leadership, Ride.
- They can not practice these Thief skills: Attack, Backstab, Dodge,
  Envenom, Hide, Missile, Pick, Piercing, Sneak, Steal.
- They have the ability to see in the dark without a light source.
- They suffer tremendous damage under sunlight, and can suffer
  **Sundeath**, which resets the troll back to level 1 from **ANY**
  level.
- A Troll will see all non-Trolls except Black Númenóreans in the room
  by their race name (e.g., \*an Elf\*, -Snarf the Orc-). The same
  applies for non-Trolls seeing Trolls.
- Trolls do not have any citizenships, but can do a quest to become a
  citizen of Dol Guldur. They do have 3 troll friendly rent spots.
- All Trolls can **drain** the blood from corpses to drink and fill
  skins with. Blood acts as both food and drink.

### Cave trolls

- Cave trolls have slightly increased hit point regeneration. This bonus
  is increased when in a cave or tunnel.
- Right now it is assumed that they have +1 hit regen in general, and +2
  hit regen in caves. This has NOT been proven.
- The cave troll regen appears to stack with being -comfortable or -very
  comfortable.
- Cave Trolls have huge bashes which may cause the victim to hurtle and
  collide with a nearby engaged target.
- The bonus bash seems to send the other target to be affected by **bash
  disengage**.
- The chance of landing the bonus bash is increased with your Dex and %
  praced in your weapon skill. It is useless vs a single target.

### Hill trolls

- They deal extra damage to stunned opponents when wielding a one-handed
  or two-handed concussion weapon.
- Hill trolls do small bonus damage when using concussion weapons vs
  bashed targets.
- They enjoy storming into battle and get a higher offensive bonus when
  aggressive or berserk.
- They can burrow under certain conditions. There is a quest troll in
  the lower level of warrens that can give a Hill Troll only quest.
- The room with the quest mob is **Grimy Little Burrow**, and the quest
  giver is **grimy hill troll**. It is a multi-stage, 3 part quest to
  finish it.
- They can only dig one room holes, and only in rooms that are hills
  after doing the quest. You cannot dig in any indoor rooms at all. Nor
  forests, plains, etc...
- If you use the command **burrow**, you dig an exit down with a close
  able door on it.
- If you use the command **burrow quickly**, you dig an exit down about
  twice as fast, but with no door on it.
- Using **borrow** only uses up a few moves. It is a delayed command.

### Mountain trolls

- Mountain trolls are highly efficient with battle rams, moving them
  with increased speed and reduced move cost.
- Mountain Trolls will sometimes hit nearby targets with wild attacks
  when engaged in combat.
- The chance to land the extra wild swing depends on Dex and your % in
  weapon skill praced. It is useless vs a single target.
- The wild swings can strike multiple opponents, but doesn't seem to
  matter on weapon wielded or using unarmed.
- Mountain Trolls can shake trees, push boulders, drag corpses, open
  doors, and dig with shovel at increased speed and reduced move cost.
