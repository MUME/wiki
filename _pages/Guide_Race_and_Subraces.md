Guide Race and Subraces

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

""In the last years of Denethor I the race of uruks, black orcs of great
strength, first appeared out of Mordor, and in 2475 they swept across
Ithilien and took Osgiliath."

Appendix A, JRRT, Return of the King

This guide is all about races and subraces in MUME.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at: <https://mume.org/help/help_index>

**Bold** words can be looked up in the games help files. Like **help
race**.

First the playable races of the Free People of the West will be listed.
Then the Followers of Sauron.

The race overview will be first, followed by details of each playable
subrace. Generally each race will list the benefits of playing before
the penalties of playing.

The Free People of the West are made up of various groups of subraces
coming from dwarves, elves, half-elves, hobbits, and men. Generally in
the game most characters that are of the Free People are good, and you
probably should not kill them. The only common except to this rule is
men that are bandits, robbers, ruffians, muggers, footpads, thieves,
smugglers, outlaws, and assassins. And crazed dwarves.
