\> **examine horn**

The thick and knotted branch from which this horn was carved appears to
have

once been a beech tree's mighty bough. Its rough surface, both within
and

without, shows that it was either left unfinished or was made with
little

appreciation for the wood's quality. It has the shape of a ram's horn
but

having no distinct mouthpiece it is a marvel that any sound resonates
through

it. A good blow, though, produces a deep, reverberating call. A thin,
twisted

vine is secured at either end so that the horn can be easily slung.

\> **consider horn**

It is a rough wooden horn.

It weighs five pounds.

## Other

Blowing the horn causes any roots that might be holding you to loosen
their grip. 'use horn' to blow the horn.
