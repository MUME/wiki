Newbie Guide NPCs and Mobs

This guide written and published by p(Baca/Endo)

“It was Sam's first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not
like it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He
wondered what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was
really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long
march from his home; and if he would rather have stayed there in peace.”

JRRT, The Two Towers

This guide is about NPCs and types of mobs and how to interact with them
or their common tatics.

Many parts of this guild reference to the MUME help pages which can be
found at: <https://mume.org/help/help_index>

Bold words can be looked up in the games help files. Like help mobile.

NPCs (Non-Player Characters) are game controlled mobs you can sometimes
interact with or are just there as part of the games setting. Mobs
(mobile) is the word commonly applied to any animal, creature, plant, or
monster that is a potential target of combat.
