## Escape

(Thief Skill)

If you are the buffer in a fight and you wish to stop fighting, you may
ESCAPE instead of fleeing. Escape offers the following advantages:

\- You can choose in which direction to move if you manage to escape:
when you

` flee, you run in a random direction.`

\- You can escape even if there are no available exits. "Escape" with no

` arguments will simply interrupt the fight.`

The chance of successfully escaping depends on your dexterity, on the
number of your opponents, on the difference between your and your
opponent's level and on how well you practiced this skill. Escaping
automatically sets your mood to wimpy.

If nobody is attacking you, you should DISENGAGE instead of escaping.

Examples:

` > escape`

` > escape north`

Knowing how to escape also makes it easier for your bodyguard (if you
have one) to keep you out of trouble efficiently.
