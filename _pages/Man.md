![](Aragorn.jpg "Aragorn.jpg")''\]\] As with our own world, **man** is
the most varied of the races. While one may be kind and gentle, another
may be vicious and evil. Man is the 'standard' race, and are competent
at most professions.

Men are one of the youngest races to have awakened on
[Arda](Arda "wikilink"). They are one of the most widespread races,
having left their birthplace of Hildórien and traveled westward
following the sun. In the ages since their awakening, men have built
fortresses to guard against evil ranging from the northern wastes to the
gates of [Mordor](Mordor "wikilink") as well as populated areas as far
as the [Lonely Mountain](Lonely_Mountain "wikilink").

Men are divided into a number of subraces, the most notable of those
being [Beornings](Beorning "wikilink") and [Black
Númenóreans](Black_Númenórean "wikilink"). More commonly seen, though,
are the [Eriadoran](Eriadoran "wikilink"),
[Dúnedain](Dúnedain "wikilink"), and [Rohirrim](Rohirrim "wikilink").

## Men in [Mume](MUME "wikilink")

Men within Mume are the only race with with the ability to excel in any
class. As in Tolkien, they are one of the most common races. Men within
Mume have some perks that other races don't have:

- Their moves regenerate at a quicker rate
- They have average stats
- They are able to travel in all terrain without any difficulties

The subraces of Men have additional modifications. Recommended for new
players are

- [Eriadoran](Eriadoran "wikilink")
- [Rohirrim](Rohirrim "wikilink")
- [Dúnedain](Dúnedain "wikilink")

There are two further subraces that come with significant modifications
which provide a very different playing experience and which are suited
for more experienced players:

- [Beornings](Beorning "wikilink"), who have the ability to shapeshift
  into bears, and
- [Black Númenóreans](Black_Númenórean "wikilink"), the race of Men
  under the guide of Sauron.
