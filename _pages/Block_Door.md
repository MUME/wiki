**Block Door** is a level 9 [mage](mage "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). If cast on a closed [door](door "wikilink")
it will block the door from being opened for some time. The only way to
remove the block before it expires is with the [Break
Door](Break_Door "wikilink") spell, by trying to [bash](bash "wikilink")
(unlikely to succeed), or with special rare [items](item "wikilink").
The spell does not work on natural closable [exits](exit "wikilink"),
like branches.

The spell is nearly exclusively used as part of [player
killing](player_killing "wikilink") to lock one or several opponents in
a closed area.
