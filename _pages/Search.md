## Search

(Thief Skill) \[Delayed Command\]

This skill enables you to search for otherwise hidden people, exits and
objects in the room.

With a given direction, you search for a secret door in that way. The
better you are, the more likely you will find something (if there is
anything to discover).

Also, type "search" with no arguments to look for hidden objects.

Type "search <effort>" (where <effort> is one of quickly, fast,
normally, carefully, thoroughly) to look for hidden people. Your chances
of success will depend on your eyesight, hearing and sense of smell, as
well as on your search skill.

Examples:

`  > search up            searches for a hidden exit upwards`
`  > search               searches for hidden items`
`  > search q             searches quickly for hidden beings in the room`
