title: Rules Reimbursement Policy
---

Here are some examples of former policies as guidelines when you want
one of the Valar to intercede on your behalf. You should find that if a
ruling exists which matches your situation then that ruling will stand.

#### Crash, Lost Gear after Mobdeath

- Scenario: X died and was about to go retrieve the corpse when the game
  crashed. Thus all the equipment X had was erased. X seeks
  reimbursement.
- Verdict: No reimbursement.
- Reason: As X is technically dead, the idea of someone looting theirown
  corpse is not very healthy. Consider yourself lucky if you perform the
  feat.

<!-- -->

- Subset: X loots the corpse and then the game crashes before your
  charactersaves. Thus the gear is gone when X returns.

#### Crash, Looted enemy corpse and lost gear

- Scenario: X loots or attempts to loot gear from a dead mobile or
  enemy Y. Game crashes before equipment saves.
- Verdict: No reimbursement.
- Reason: The player who looted could have been killed 1 minute later by
  someone willing to return the gear. Its impossible to say what would
  happen if there had not been a crash, so we don't speculate.

#### Pkill, Loss of Alignment by X

- Scenario: Whitie X pkills Whitie Y. X loses alignment and then suffers
  for his evilness.
- Verdict: No action.
- Reason: X should know what they are doing. Pkill makes you evil, fast.

#### Pkill, Loss of Alignment by Z

- Scenario: Whitie X kills Whitie or good mob Y. Z who is grouped with
  X, also loses alignment, even though Z took no part in the pkill and
  was opposed to it.
- Verdict: Restoration of Z's alignment if it was significant. Removal
  of exp gained by Z. This only happens if Z did not have time to
  ungroup.
- Reason: To some extent, Z was an innocent bystander who could not
  react in time and so should not be penalised.
- Subset: X pkills Z, causing the loss of alignment. Verdict as above.
  This is a bug.

#### Regeneration of a Zone leading to Death

- Scenario: While exploring a Zone, it regenerates, the mobiles
  subsequently killing X (eg. locked in a room with large group of
  aggressive mobs).
- Verdict: No Reimbursement.
- Reason: Since these can be predicted, they are avoidable.

<!-- -->

- Subset: If it can be shown that an immortal was to blame for the
  regeneration (eg. it regenned 4 mins after the last regen) then a full
  reimbursement will be shown. HOWEVER, don't assume this is the case
  unless you have evidence!

#### Server crashes, Player dies

- Scenario: One of the servers to MUME stops transmitting. The character
  of the player dies.
- Verdict: No reimbursement.
- Reason: How you connect to the game is outside the control of MUME.
- Subset: Any of a wide variety: site from where you play dies,
  transatlantic link nonresponsive, sudden lag, your mum picks up the
  phone etc. All same verdict.

#### FIRE unreachable

- Scenario: The site on which MUME runs becomes unreachable from the
  outside world. An imp cannot connect to rent everyone.
- Verdict: Reimbursement of exp, tps, age. Reimbursement of some eq is
  possible, but not guaranteed.
- Reason: In this case, MUME and FIRE are synonymous and so is not
  treated in the same way as server crash.

Note: if the game can be crashed or everyone rented or the rent-cost
disabled later, then this scenario does not apply.

#### Immortal wizkills X

- Scenario: An immortal kills X without just cause.
- Verdict: Reimbursement.
- Reason: Immortals are forbidden to interfere in the running of the
  game in this manner.
- Subset: The player of the immortal had a grudge against X. Same as
  above.

NOTE: The above are guidelines, and we choose to ignore them in
exceptional circumstances. However, NEVER ever assume that this means
you should ask in a hopeless situation on the off chance. If you have
any doubts, assume we will not change matters.
