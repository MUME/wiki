The **Shire** is a civilized place located in the old Kingdom of
Arthedain. It is far from the great nations of the South, the nearest
other place being [Bree](Bree "wikilink") a few miles East. The Shire is
divided into four main parts: the North, South, East and West Farthings.
Located east of the Baranduin (Brandywine) is Buckland. Most
[Hobbits](Hobbit "wikilink") from the Farthings consider Bucklanders
very queer, while Bucklanders think much the same of the others. Lying
on the Eastern border of Buckland stretches the [Old
Forest](Old_Forest "wikilink"); a place very few dare to enter.

The Shire was first inhabited in 1601 by a few adventurous Hobbits from
Bree, and since then has become the main home of Hobbits. There are no
other [races](race "wikilink") living in the Shire, but occasionally one
might see a [Dwarf](Dwarf "wikilink"), or two, and sadly many
[Elves](Elf "wikilink") passing through the South Farthing on their way
West, never to return.
