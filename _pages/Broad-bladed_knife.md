\> **look knife**

This is a broad knife with a rough wooden handle. Apparently, it has
other

uses than just cutting meat.

\> **consider knife**

This slashing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is awful while attacking and poor while defending; its speed is fast,
and it inflicts very little damage upon hitting.

It weighs a few ounces.
