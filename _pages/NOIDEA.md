title: NOIDEA
---

These are **ideas** which have been considered by the
[MUME](MUME "wikilink") management (in this case principally the
implementors) and ruled to never appear as long as they draw breath:

## Races

- Ents, wargs or horses as player characters

<!-- -->

- [Orcs](Orc "wikilink") with teleport capability or any
  [spell](spell "wikilink") that they had prior to introduction of
  [shaman](shaman "wikilink") class

<!-- -->

- [Trolls](Troll "wikilink") having [mounts](mount "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- Trolls without sundeath

<!-- -->

- Trolls not accidentally [fleeing](flee "wikilink") into sunlight

<!-- -->

- Trolls being able to [hide](hide "wikilink"),
  [sneak](sneak "wikilink"), or [cast](cast "wikilink") spells

<!-- -->

- Trolls with [shops](shop "wikilink") (that can do anything but
  mending)

<!-- -->

- BNs with a [city](city "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- BNs with a [warrior](warrior "wikilink")
  [guildmaster](guild "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- Evil characters being able to become immortal

## Classes

- Additional [class](class "wikilink")-dependent
  [skills](skill "wikilink"). The move is away from unique abilities for
  classes and

`  towards racial-modifiers of abilities/skills.`

## Levels and Skills

- Experience for casting healing spells

<!-- -->

- A means of transferring exp to tp/wp or vice-versa

<!-- -->

- A spell for transferring hps to [mana](mana "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- [Bashing](Bash "wikilink") someone removing or delaying their autoflee

<!-- -->

- WPs or scalps required to level

## Equipment

- Being able to buy heals or healing spells from
  clerical-[mobiles](mobile "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- Banks and places to store excess [equipment](equipment "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- A perfect or even near-playable system for firing into adjacent rooms

<!-- -->

- Critical hits negated by [armour](armour "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- [Level](Level "wikilink")-dependant equipment

## General

- Splitting MUME in two (or more) games (+/-pk, +/-Tolkien, etc)

<!-- -->

- An auction channel

<!-- -->

- Safe areas where newbies can learn [commands](commands "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- Any game effect which relies on NOQUIT or NOVOID flag. They exist
  solely for [linkdrop](link "wikilink")/[rent](rent "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- Having anything on noidea removed (Unless the idea of removal was
  thought of by an Implementor)

<!-- -->

- Removal of the entire noidea list. (This is so much a NOIDEA it needs
  2 Implementors to agree

`  on it, so not much chance of that)`

- Implementation of the SUPERIDEA, or any similar forms, which by
  nature, would act to supercede

`  the NOIDEA category`
