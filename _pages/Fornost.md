After the first few centuries of the Third Age, the first city and
capital of the Dunedain kingdom of Arnor was **Fornost**. It was a
powerful and important city, and came under attack from the Witch-king
of Angmar. Finally, in 1974 the armies of the Witch-king took Fornost
and destroyed much of it. It was reclaimed the following year, yet the
ruined city was deserted and its people scattered and the Royal Court
mostly destroyed.

Fornost later became a notable ruin on the Great North-South Road, which
had many years ago been a great highway between the glorious capital of
Arnor and the capital of Gondor, Minas Tirith.

### Mume's Fornost

A few hundred years after the wars with Angmar, settlers returned to the
ruined city, and started rebuilding parts of it. Most of the excellence
in masonry and other crafts forgotten by then, the reborn city is not by
far equal to its predecessor in beauty and might.

Until present date, about half the original city has been reinhabitated,
protected by a wooden palisade from the haunts of the ruined [western
part](Old_Fornost "wikilink").

### Seedy Underbelly

Some more seedy types like to hide out in the more dangerous areas of
Fornost. [Olly](Olly "wikilink") hosts them in his
[tavern](Olly's_Tavern "wikilink"), but some prefer to stay more hidden
from plain sight. Ask around, if you are inclined toward the
clandestine...

### Entrance

#### A note on the gate

The southern gate of Fornost consists of two parts: a portcullis and a
gate. From outside both - on either the northern side (By the Gate) or
southern side (Before the Gates of Fornost) - you must call to have them
opened. Once the closest part of the gate is opened, you can enter the
next room (Under the Wall, Between the Gates). From this room, you must
"say open". This opens both the portcullis and the gate simultaneously,
allowing exit of this room toward either direction. You can also "say
open portcullis" or "say open irongate" if you want only one exit to be
opened.
