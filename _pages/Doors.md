Opens, closes, locks or unlocks (if you have an appropriate key) a door
or a container.

You can open, close, lock or unlock the exits of the room by the exact
name of the exit (e.g. \> open gate) or by giving the direction of the
exit (e.g. \> open exit s). Secret exits have to be addressed by their
exact name. <nowiki>g

(if there's more than one to choose from)

Note that latched doors can be locked and unlocked without a key.
