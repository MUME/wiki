**Q: How do I hold my weapon?**

A: Type '[wield](wield "wikilink") sword' (for example).

**Q: How do I put on my clothes?**

A: Type "[wear](wear "wikilink") [cloak](cloak "wikilink")" (for
example), or "wear all" after you have gotten your newbie kit.

**Q: It says my hands are full!**

A: You've only got two hands. Commonly, you will wield your
[weapon](weapon "wikilink") in one, and wear a
[shield](shield "wikilink") on the other arm, unless you are using a
[two-handed sword](two-handed_weapon "wikilink"). If you need to hold a
pan, for example, you have to '[remove](remove "wikilink")' the sword or
shield first (or [sheathe](sheathe "wikilink") it).

**Q: How do I use a lantern or torch?**

"[Hold](Hold "wikilink") [torch](torch "wikilink")" or "hold
[lantern](lantern "wikilink")" will work, but then you can't use that
hand for your weapon or shield. A lantern can be worn on your
[belt](belt "wikilink"), if you have one, with 'wear lantern belt'. This
will automatically light it. 'Remove lantern' when it's day to save
fuel. If you have a flask of [oil](oil "wikilink"), you can refill your
lantern (while wearing it) by typing '[fill](fill "wikilink") lantern'.

**Q: How do I pour water in my water skin?**

A: Type "[pour](pour "wikilink") [water](water "wikilink")
[skin](water_skin "wikilink")", "pour well skin", "pour fountain skin",
etc. In MUME command structure, words like 'in', 'from', etc. are
usually omitted. So, you drink from the skin by typing
"[drink](drink "wikilink") skin".

**Q: How do I see what I have?**

A: Type '[equipment](equipment "wikilink")' (or 'eq') to see what you
are wearing and wielding. Type '[inventory](inventory "wikilink")' (or
'i') to see what you are carrying around with you. If you have too many
things, you won't be able to pick up stuff, but you can put things in
[sacks](containers "wikilink"), backpacks, pouches, etc.

You look in your sack by typing '[examine](examine "wikilink") sack'.
You get a biscuit out of your sack by typing '[get](get "wikilink")
biscuit sack'. You put all your biscuits in your sack with
'[put](put "wikilink") all.biscuit sack'.

**Q: Suppose I have two sacks?**

A: You use the following syntax: "examine 2.sack", "get all 2.corpse",
"ride 2.horse".

**Q: How do I use a canoe?**

A: Just get the [canoe](canoe "wikilink") and carry it around. If you
have it in your inventory, it is the same as being in the canoe. Only
one person can use a boat.

**Q: "This shield/article of clothing/footwear doesn't fit." "This sword
is dented." "This armour is worn out."**

A: Take the item to the appropriate merchant and type
'[mend](mend "wikilink") <item>'. The merchant will charge you for his
work. To be on the safe side, wait there for 2 minutes until it is done.
You may leave, but if you do not come back very soon,
[rent](rent "wikilink") (even if you login right back), or die, he will
sell your item. Notice also that some merchants cannot see
[shrouded](shroud "wikilink") or [sneaking](sneak "wikilink") people and
may decide that you are not there unless you show yourself. If the only
thing wrong with the item is that it is the wrong size for you, you can
type '[resize](resize "wikilink") <item>' and get it back immediately,
without wait.
