A tough and sturdy people, the creation of Mahal, the Vala Aulë. They
are stubborn and aggressive, yet honourable and steadfast companions.
The Dwarves have had probably the most disastrous time in the Third Age,
with their homes being taken from them, most notably the Mines of Moria
which they call Khazad-dûm. Today the main strongholds of Dwarves are in
the East.

## MUME DWARVES

Although short, they contain a great strength and hence can make
excellent warriors. They can carry a heavier load on their shoulders
than other races without exhausting themselves. Their stoutness,
however, reduces their agility, and for this reason they tend to make
terrible thieves. Being short, Dwarves do not find themselves at ease
when mounting horses.
