![](Gimli.jpg "Gimli.jpg")''\]\] **Dwarves** are a tough and sturdy
people, the creation of Mahal, the Vala Aulë. They are stubborn and
aggressive, yet honourable and steadfast companions. The Dwarves have
had probably the most disastrous time in the Third Age, with their homes
being taken from them, most notably the Mines of
[Moria](Moria "wikilink") which they call Khazad-dûm. Today the main
strongholds of Dwarves are in the East.

## Dwarves in [MUME](MUME "wikilink")

Although short, they contain a great strength and hence can make
excellent [warriors](warrior "wikilink"). They can carry a heavier load
on their shoulders than other [races](race "wikilink") without
exhausting themselves. Their stoutness, however, reduces their agility,
and for this reason they tend to make terrible
[thieves](thief "wikilink"). Being short, Dwarves do not find themselves
at ease when mounting horses.

They speak their native language of [Khuzdul](Khuzdul "wikilink"), as
well as [Westron](Westron "wikilink") the common language of men.

Dwarves get

- +5% [OB](Offensive_bonus "wikilink") when not mounted and wielding an
  [axe](cleaving "wikilink").
- maluses when riding larger horses and thus should ride mules or ponies
  instead.

Dwarven players can start the game in the [Tower
Hills](Tower_Hills "wikilink"), [Bree](Bree "wikilink"),
[Fornost](Fornost "wikilink"), and are the only race which can start in
the [Blue Mountains](Blue_Mountains "wikilink").
