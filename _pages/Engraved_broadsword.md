title: Engraved broadsword

\> **look sword**

This weapon has a broad polished silver blade upon which many strange
runes

and symbols have been carved. The hilt is bound with fine leather
through

which threads of gold have been entwined. A solid silver pommel protects
the

wielder's hand in combat. The weapon is perfectly balanced and can be
swung

with an ease belying its deadliness.

\> **consider sword**

It is an engraved broadsword.

This slashing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is average while attacking and excellent while defending; its speed
is average, and it inflicts average damage upon hitting.

It weighs four pounds.

## Opinions

Best slashing weapon for defense and definitely the most widely used
defensive weapon available. To wield it efficiently, you must have 13 or
more [strength](strength "wikilink"), this puts it within reach of most
casters who practice the [strength](Strength_Spell "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink").
