**Pick** is a [thief](thief "wikilink") [skill](skill "wikilink") that
allows you to pick locks. Not all locks can be picked.

It is wise to make sure the lock is locked first. If you attempt to pick
a lock that is actually unlocked, there is a chance you might accidently
lock it.

Holding/Wearing [lockpicks](lockpicks "wikilink") will improve your
chances at picking.

Examples:

`  > pick door north`
`  > pick oakdoor`
`  > pick hiddensafe`
