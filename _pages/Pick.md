## Pick

(Thief Skill)

For picking locks. Not all locks can be picked.

It is wise to make sure the lock is locked first. If you attempt to pick
a lock that is actually unlocked, there is a chance you might accidently
lock it.

Holding lockpicks in your hands will improve your chances at picking.
Also, rumour has it that several people in Arda can improve your
lockpicks - at a price.

Examples:

`  > pick door north`
`  > pick oakdoor`
`  > pick hiddensafe`
