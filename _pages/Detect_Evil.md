**Detect evil** is a level 1 [cleric](cleric "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). It will tell you the
[alignment](alignment "wikilink") of the creature that it is cast upon.
This can be handy if you are unsure whether a creature has a good align
and thus should not be attacked. Mostly, however, this is rather easy to
tell and thus the spell is rather useless.
