A **focus** is an [object](item "wikilink") imbued with powerful magic
and bound to its owner. Several kinds of foci exist, each endowed with
different powers. A [warrior](warrior "wikilink") might prefer a focus
which enhances his battle prowess or weakens his enemies, a
[sorcerer](caster "wikilink") could instead focus on his arcane arts or
on healing. Certain focus powers are constantly active; others must be
explicitly called upon, by [using](use "wikilink") the item - on
oneself, on someone else or on an entire [group](group "wikilink").

Foci are created by casting '[Create Focus](Create_Focus "wikilink")' on
the appropriate material component. If the ceremony is performed in the
right place and in the right way, the vessel must also be
[enchanted](enchant "wikilink") and [blessed](bless "wikilink"). When
all is done correctly the focus is bound to the caster.

People cannot own more than one focus at any given time: old foci will
lose their powers whenever a new focus is created.

An in depth explanation of the focus system can be found under [Staff,
Gem, and Focus Guide](Staff,_Gem_and_Focus_guide "wikilink").

Once a focus is created you can call an [Eagle](Eagle "wikilink").
