title: Focus
---

A focus is an object imbued with powerful magic and bound to its owner.
Several kinds of foci are rumoured to exist, each endowed with different
powers. A warrior might prefer a focus which enhances his battle prowess
or weakens his enemies, a sorcerer could instead focus on his arcane
arts or on healing. Certain focus powers are constantly active; others
must be explicitly called upon, by USING the item - on oneself, on
someone else or on an entire group.

Foci are created by casting 'create focus' on the appropriate material
component. If the ceremony is performed in the right place and in the
right way, the vessel must also be enchanted and blessed. When all is
done correctly the foci is bound to the caster.

People cannot own more than one focus at any given time: old foci will
lose their powers whenever a new focus is created.
