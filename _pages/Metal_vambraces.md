\> **examine vambraces**
Several plates of thin metal are attached to each other to form this
piece of
armour. It covers the complete arm except for the elbow, which is
covered with
small iron links. Leather strips encircle the vambraces, providing a way
to
close them around the arm. A couple of metal buckles at the ends of
the
vambraces enable attachment to other pieces of armour.
\> **consider vambraces**
They are a pair of metal vambraces.
They weigh twelve pounds.
