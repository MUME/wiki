*For the spell, see [Sleep Spell](Sleep_Spell "wikilink").*

If you feel weary you can **sleep** to recuperate. You will recover
faster than simply [resting](rest "wikilink"). However, note that when
you are sleeping you will not hear or see anything that is going on
around you, which makes you vulnerable to surprise attacks.

When you are done sleeping you can **wake**.
