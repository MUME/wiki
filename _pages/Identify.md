This spell, when cast on an object, will reveal some of the important
properties of the object. It also gives the caster the magical 'key'
which would be used to find instances of such objects with the 'locate'
spell.

When cast on a mobile or player, it provides a locate key but does not
provide additional information (see also: DIVINATION). NOTE: It is
strongly suggested not to reveal the exact statistics of items you
identify. Saying that "sword X is slighly better at parrying than sword
Y, but you need to be very strong in order to use it efficiently" is
acceptable.

Publishing tables of item statistics, either via boards or by web or by
any other means, is highly frowned upon by the management. Please
refrain from doing so.

A clarification: MAGIC refers to long-lasting magical effects, such as
the enchantment on a weapon or the effects of 'armour' or 'shield'.
SPELL refers to instantaneous effects, such as a fireball or a dispel
magic. A weapon that is efficient vs SPELL can't be enchanted or
dispelled; it does not have special properties against magical
opponents.

Example: \> cast 'identify' ring
