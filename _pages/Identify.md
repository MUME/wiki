**Identify** is a [level](level "wikilink") 15 [mage](mage "wikilink")
[spell](spell "wikilink"). When [cast](cast "wikilink") on an
[object](item "wikilink"), this spell will reveal some of the important
properties of the object. It also gives the caster the magical 'key'
which would be used to find instances of such objects with the
'[locate](locate "wikilink")' spell.

When cast on a [mobile](mobile "wikilink") or player, it provides a
locate key but does not provide additional information (see also:
[Divination](Divination "wikilink")).

Syntax : cast 'identify' \<object\>/\<mobile\>/\<player\> Type :
Miscellaneous Accumulative: N/A Duration : No Casting : Extremely long
Position : Standing Level : Level 15 Class : Magic User Min. Mana : 90
Duration : No

NOTE: It is strongly suggested not to reveal the exact
[statistics](statistic "wikilink") of items you identify. Saying that
"sword X is slighly better at parrying than sword Y, but you need to be
very strong in order to use it efficiently" is acceptable.

Publishing tables of item statistics, either via boards or by web or by
any other means, is highly frowned upon by the management. Please
refrain from doing so.

A clarification: MAGIC refers to long-lasting magical effects, such as
the [enchantment](enchant "wikilink") on a [weapon](weapon "wikilink")
or the effects of '[armour](Armour_Spell "wikilink")' or
'[shield](Shield_Spell "wikilink")'. SPELL refers to instantaneous
effects, such as a fireball or a dispel magic. A weapon that is
efficient vs SPELL can't be enchanted or dispelled; it does not have
special properties against magical opponents.

Example: \> cast 'identify' ring
