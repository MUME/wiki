Lockpicks can be bought from locksmiths and from somewhat more shady
people. They make it easier to pick a lock open or closed: you only need
to have them in your inventory, in your equipment, or on a worn keyring.

Lockpicks can be improved by various locksmiths and by some other
skilled people. To find out what they want for their services, try
asking them about lockpicks.
