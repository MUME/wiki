title: A traveller's diary
---

\> **examine diary**
The book is quite small, half-covered in dust and sand and some grass
remnants. On the front there is nothing to be read; or, if there was,
the print is no longer readable. Judging from its worn-out appearance,
this book must have served as some sort of diary or notebook for
someone
who travelled in many rough spots. Its pages are falling apart from
the
cover, and some have already gone missing. Due to the missing parts and
to
the stained pages, understanding the book's contents is a difficult
task.
\> **consider diary**
It is a traveller's diary.
It weighs half a pound.
