\> **examine ruby**
This large ruby would fit nicely into your hand. It has been cut by some
very
skilled craftsman and its sides are perfectly symmetrical. The ruby
glows in a
mysterious red light; a closer look at the inside reveals a million
small
rays and sparks of red, which are reflected and broken more often than
there
are glowing sparks in a great fire.
\> **consider ruby**
