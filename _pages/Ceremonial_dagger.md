\> **look dagger**

The silvery blade is heavier and thicker than most daggers and is
obviously

ancient. Miniature carvings on its surface depict battles against a dark
army,

resulting in the fall of Eregion.

\> **consider dagger**

It is a ceremonial dagger (flawless, new).

This piercing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is average while attacking and excellent while defending; its speed
is very fast, and it inflicts average damage upon hitting.

It weighs about one pound.

## Opinion

Probably the dagger that gives most defence bonus.
