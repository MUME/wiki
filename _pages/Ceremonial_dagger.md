## A ceremonial dagger

<nowiki>g !# C\>exa dagger The silvery blade is heavier and thicker than
most daggers and is obviously ancient. Miniature carvings on its surface
depict battles against a dark army, resulting in the fall of Eregion.

!# C\>con dagger It is a ceremonial dagger (flawless, new). This
piercing weapon can be wielded one-handed. It is average while attacking
and excellent while defending; its speed is very fast, and it inflicts
average damage upon hitting. It weighs about one pound.

## Opinion

Probably the dagger that gives most defence bonus.
