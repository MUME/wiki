\> **look sword**

The hilt of the sword is carved out of a single piece of shining black
stone.

Its blade is of a strange dark metal, which lacks lustre and seems to
absorb

all light that falls on it.

\> **consider sword**

This slashing weapon can be wielded one-handed.

It is average while attacking and excellent while defending; its speed
is fast, and it inflicts little damage upon hitting.

It weighs three pounds.
